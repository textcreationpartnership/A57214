            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe</hi> Author <hi>of theſe</hi> enſuing Epiſtles, <hi>after he arrived at a true underſtanding of Things, did not</hi> value <hi>himſelf upon the account of that</hi> ſplendor <hi>and</hi> magnificence, <hi>wherein he</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>appeared upon the</hi> Stage <hi>of this World: For though he were</hi> born <hi>of a</hi> worthy Family; <hi>had many</hi> great <hi>and</hi> noble Relations; <hi>enjoyed the</hi> acceſſion <hi>of a</hi> comely Perſonage <hi>and</hi> Preſence; <hi>lived in high</hi> Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Opulency, <hi>and</hi> Credit, <hi>in the ſtate and condition of a</hi> Merchant <hi>in the</hi> City <hi>of</hi> London <hi>for many Years; yet all theſe things he paſſeth by, in the</hi> Character <hi>which he hereafter gives of</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45369:3"/>
               <hi>For, after he was once truly</hi> enlightned, <hi>none of them did</hi> elate, <hi>or lift up his</hi> Mind; <hi>nay, he was willing to</hi> ſacrifice <hi>them all to a better</hi> proſpect, <hi>even a</hi> Piſgah-view <hi>of the</hi> Heavenly Canaan: <hi>Hence it was that he</hi> choſe <hi>rather to</hi> ſuffer Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a deſpiſed People, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon. <hi>Hence alſo it came to paſs, that as the Work of</hi> Converſion <hi>is called a</hi> New Birth, (<hi>as if the</hi> true Date <hi>of our</hi> Lives <hi>did</hi> Commence <hi>therefrom</hi>) <hi>ſo our</hi> Author over-looked <hi>the former part of his</hi> Life, (<hi>as I</hi> hinted <hi>but now</hi>) <hi>in the</hi> account <hi>he gives of himſelf; neither did it any otherwiſe</hi> affect <hi>him, than with</hi> regret <hi>and</hi> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>for having lived ſo</hi> unfruitfully <hi>ſo long a time. To</hi> eat, drink, <hi>and be</hi> cloathed, <hi>and ſo to</hi> walk <hi>up and down on the face of the</hi> Earth, <hi>(as the manner of moſt Men is) is but a low, mean, and unprofitable Life: For then we begin to live profitably, when we come to</hi> underſtand <hi>the</hi> uſe <hi>of</hi> Life, <hi>and when we</hi> devote <hi>it to the</hi> proſecution <hi>of thoſe</hi> ends <hi>for which</hi> it <hi>was</hi> given <hi>us, which are, The</hi> Glory of God, <hi>the</hi> Good of our Neighbour, <hi>and the</hi> Salvation <hi>of our own, and others</hi> Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It pleaſed</hi> God <hi>to carry the</hi> Author <hi>above the</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>of this</hi> World, <hi>by breaking in upon his</hi> Soul <hi>in a</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>and</hi> Heavenly Work, <hi>wherewith he was exerciſed for</hi> ſome <hi>Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having thus changed his</hi> Station, <hi>and</hi> given up his Name to Chriſt, <hi>he was firſt engaged in a</hi> particular <hi>FOrm, amongst the People called</hi> Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45369:3"/>
               <hi>The</hi> manner <hi>how he came to be engaged in that</hi> Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>his</hi> carriage <hi>therein, and</hi> receſſion <hi>therefrom, cannot be better expreſſed, than in his own</hi> words, <hi>in a</hi> Letter <hi>of his ſent from</hi> Barbadoes <hi>(where he for above twenty Years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided) dated</hi> Novemb. 30. 1678.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In the Year 1654, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> I became a <hi>Quaker;</hi> in which Diſpenſation of <hi>John,</hi> I was truly baptized into Repentance and amendment of Life, which blotted out all my former Sins, and for two Years time, was in the ſtrength of this Baptiſm carried with delight both to do and to ſuffer, even above and beyond my Equals: All which time I lived after the Mode of that Sect, a ſevere ſtrict Life, a <hi>Phariſee</hi> of <hi>Phariſees,</hi> till in the Year 1656, when my dear Brother <hi>J. N.</hi> ſuffered for confeſſing to Chriſt in the Saints; my love to that Teſtimony, made me willing to ſtand by him in his Sufferings, and to bear his Croſs; for which Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the World, the Powers of Darkneſs then ruling, my Kindred, and my Brethren the <hi>Quakers,</hi> hated me, and ſold me into <hi>Egypt,</hi> by their many falſe Reports: Yet there the Lord my God appeared to me; and finding me in my Innocency, wherewith he had cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed me, hath ever ſince become my exceeding great Reward.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He being thus in great part</hi> diſingaged <hi>from that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Form <hi>of</hi> Profeſſion, <hi>having a</hi> deep inſight <hi>into things,
<pb facs="tcp:45369:4"/>and</hi> judging <hi>that the</hi> whole Body of Truth <hi>was not</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed <hi>within the</hi> Bounds <hi>of one</hi> particular Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>but lay</hi> ſcattered <hi>and</hi> diſperſed <hi>amongst the</hi> Outcaſts <hi>of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>(i.e.) The ſeveral</hi> Parties <hi>and</hi> Opinions, <hi>which did all</hi> (<hi>though ſome more</hi> miſtakingly, <hi>and with leſs</hi> refinedneſs <hi>than others</hi>) <hi>lay</hi> claim <hi>to</hi> Religion, <hi>and to</hi> hopes <hi>of Eternal</hi> Happineſs <hi>therein, and hereby attaining a more</hi> univerſal Spirit, <hi>he found</hi> freedom <hi>in his mind to dive into the ſeveral</hi> Forms <hi>of</hi> Profeſſors <hi>now appearing in</hi> this, <hi>or</hi> other Lands, <hi>with a deſign to</hi> cull <hi>out the</hi> Gold, (i.e.) <hi>that which was</hi> good <hi>in all, and to reject the</hi> Droſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Work, <hi>as requiring a</hi> diſcerning <hi>Judgment into</hi> things that differ, <hi>ſo apt to expoſe the</hi> Undertaker <hi>to the</hi> diſlike <hi>of</hi> moſt <hi>Parties;</hi> few, <hi>eſpecially in things of the</hi> Mind, <hi>being willing to have</hi> Errors, Miſapprehenſions, <hi>or</hi> Miſtakes, <hi>imputed to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that endeavours to</hi> interpoſe <hi>himſelf an</hi> Arbiter, <hi>or</hi> Reconciler, <hi>between</hi> Diſagreeing Parties, <hi>eſpecially in the heat of their</hi> Contentions, <hi>may receive</hi> blows <hi>from</hi> both, <hi>but</hi> thanks <hi>from</hi> neither, <hi>at leaſt, till the</hi> Fit <hi>be over, and the</hi> Mind <hi>retiring to a</hi> ſedate Recollection, <hi>becomes more</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>of, and</hi> thankful <hi>for ſuch</hi> friendly Interpoſures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> Friend <hi>then being engaged in His</hi> Thoughts <hi>in this</hi> Work, <hi>and knowing it to be a Character of</hi> pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Religion, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Willows in
<pb facs="tcp:45369:4"/>their diſtreſs; <hi>finding alſo, that a</hi> particular Spirit <hi>was very</hi> predominant <hi>among</hi> Profeſſors; <hi>the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>complaining of it in his time,</hi> That all ſought their own, <hi>and</hi> that few did naturally care for the Eſtate one of another; <hi>inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that</hi> James <hi>makes Beneficence, and</hi> doing good <hi>to others, the</hi> Symptom <hi>of</hi> True Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence it was, that in his firſt</hi> Addreſs <hi>he was willing to</hi> viſit the Poor of every Congregation, <hi>rather than the</hi> Rich; <hi>and That he did, by his early</hi> Liberality, <hi>tranſmitting</hi> Thirty pounds <hi>apiece to the</hi> Neceſſitous <hi>and</hi> Indigent <hi>of every</hi> Party; <hi>which, it ſeems was received by them all, as a</hi> Teſtimony <hi>of his</hi> general Love, <hi>as by their</hi> Acquittances <hi>hereafter mentioned may appear.</hi>

               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THeſe may inform you, That in the month of <hi>December</hi> 1666, by the way of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſad and deplorable Intelligence of <hi>London</hi>'s Deſtruction by Fire, wherewith the Beauty and Glory of that City is (like <hi>Sodom</hi>) turned into Aſhes; which when I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and throughly pondred, I did impart my thoughts to your Brother Mr. <hi>Fr. Raynes,</hi> to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Calamity would be ſo univerſal and extenſive, that multitudes muſt of neceſſity be caſt upon great extremities of Want and Miſery, and that now was a fit opportunity for all to hold out a hand of Charity towards their diſtreſſed Brethren: To which purpoſe I had You upon my Heart, to write unto you when our Fleet went, (which hath bin detained until now) to diſpoſe of the 210 <hi>l.</hi> in your hand. Now Sir, as touching your proceedings in this Buſineſs of my Requeſt, that theſe <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> with all others, might more fully diſcern the mind of my Lord in this figure of Love and Amity to them, I think it meet to let you know, that I have ſomething already written to each of thoſe <hi>Seven Congregations,</hi> (which in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time may be preſented to their view) <hi>Holding forth the Everlaſting Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt in us; the Saving Health, and univerſal free Grace of God (ready to be revealed) to all Nations, Sects and People: Together with a Declaration, or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial of that dear Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity which my Soul hath to all that fear God and work Righteouſneſs; and not only to ſuch, but likewiſe to the Rebellious, Diſobedient, and worſt of Sinners. Alſo ſomething I have to offer concerning the New Creation (God's Workmanſhip in
<pb facs="tcp:45369:6"/>Chriſt Jeſus) that which mine Eyes have ſeen, and Hands have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Word of Life, of things that now are, and must ſhortly come to paſs, when the Son in Man, the New Birth, ſhall more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be revealed, which as yet is a great Mystery to many, and hath bin long hid from Ages and Generations of formal Profeſſors of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that have wanted the Power of Love, or Chriſt Jeſus that Spirit, working all their Works in them and for them, but is now making Himſelf manifeſt in all that are born again of his Spirit, and baptized with that Water of Life which regenerateth and keepeth clean the heart.</hi> That Chaſt Virgin that only bringeth forth the Man-Child, and Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is Heir of all Things, and the Saviour of All that believe and follow Him; <hi>Who enlightens every one</hi> (with the knowledg of Good) <hi>that cometh into the World.</hi> This is He that was, and now is, and is yet to come to all ſucceeding Generations, of whom all the Prophets from <hi>Moſes</hi> until <hi>John</hi> bare Record; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah.</hi> Whoſe Day <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw and rejoiced, as do all that have Chriſt the Unction in them, who only and alone openeth Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and doth teach to ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah.</hi> Whoſe Star of old led, as his Spirit doth now lead, all the wiſe in Heart, both to find, and alſo to worſhip him acceptably, according to his Law, Mind, and Will, written therein; even Him that is the Rock of Ages, whoſe Body and Blood our Fathers did (in the Wilderneſs, as at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) taſte of; and which we their Children, that are Heirs of the ſame promiſed Spirit, do now eat, and drink, the Bread from Heaven, which is not carnal, but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the Soul into a Life and Kingdom that fadeth not away, but endureth for ever. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, having (in part) acquainted you with the reaſon of my intended Proceedings, my next care is (what I can) to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen your trouble; to which end I think it the beſt way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound three of each ſort of People, chief amongſt them, as Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the reſt, Men of good Report, into whoſe hands the 30 <hi>l.</hi> may be delivered (as a ſign of my Love) and by them be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt thoſe of their way, who are in Need, Sickneſs, or any other kind of Adverſity.</p>

            <p>TO thoſe of you that are Regenerate, and born again of the Spirit, who are Members of Chriſt Jeſus, through the ſanctification of the Spirit, Elect and Precious, to you, <hi>Grace, Mercy, and Peace be multiplied, from God our Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Amen. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1656, feeling the Birth of God in me, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, wherein I was <hi>made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Which Holy Spirit wrought ſo mightily, as to beget the New Man (Chriſt Jeſus) in me, by whom I had peace with God, and good will to all his Creation. Which Spirit of Love moved me to ſend <hi>Thirty Pounds</hi> to be diſtributed amongſt the Poor of the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church,</hi> as a ſign of my Love and good Will to them, (which I underſtood you received in the ſame Spirit of loving-kindneſs I ſent it); Not as <hi>Judas</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his Maſter into the hands of Sinners for <hi>Thirty pieces of Silver,</hi> but from one that witneſſeth the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead, whom by my ſins I had (formerly) crucified,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45369:12"/>and put to open ſhame; but having repented and amended my former bad Life, by help of his Holy Spirit of Grace, (Chriſt in me) I came to ſee that thoſe of all Religions that feared God, and acted righteouſly towards Men, were accepted of him, and dearly beloved by me; in which Spirit of Love, the Ground and Pillar of Truth, the End of the Law, and Bond of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I found freedom in my ſelf to look into all ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions; and knowing the Rock Chriſt Jeſus, on whom all the Holy Men of God are built; and having a diſcerning (by God's Grace) between the Precious and the Vile, between him that ſerveth God in the Spirit of Truth, and him that only pretendeth to ſerve him, but with a falſe Spirit; in which Spirit of God, I ſaw the difference between the true Church of God, and that which is the falſe Church. In this Underſtanding I did read many Books, written, and allowed by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bible</hi> tranſlated out of the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> by St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> Printed in two <hi>Tomes</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh-College</hi> at <hi>Doway;</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> printed at <hi>Rhemes;</hi> and have weighed and conſidered the Reaſons St. <hi>Jerome</hi> gives for tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out of the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> rather than out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which were much corrupted, as he ſaith, by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. And having purged the <hi>Latin Verſion</hi> from Faults committed by Writers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> laying aſide all other <hi>Latin Editions,</hi> which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith were in his time almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; which Tranſlation out of <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> though in many things defective, yet in ſome I find better to agree with the <hi>Truth,</hi> than that tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> As for Inſtance;</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> tranſlates, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3. You <hi>ſhall draw Water in joy out of the Saviour's Fountains.</hi> The other, <hi>You ſhall draw Waters out of the Wells of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.6. the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Doubtleſs all things are Vanity.</hi> The other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. ſaith, <hi>Verily, every Man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity;</hi> which ſeems not to be true, for the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Man, which is born of the Spirit, and hath Chriſt the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45369:12"/>New Man in him, is not altogether <hi>Vanity,</hi> for Chriſt is the <hi>Eternal and only begotten Son of God, full of Grace, and full of Truth.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> 1.14. the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh and dwelt IN us.</hi> The other, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt AMONGST us;</hi> Which Tranſlation I apprehend was to gratify thoſe that deny Chriſt come in the Fleſh of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſo exalt the Fleſh of Jeſus equal to or above the Spirit, which dwelleth in all true Believers. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſaith, <hi>Trust perfectly in the Grace which is offered you in the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The other, <hi>Hope to the end for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This I alſo apprehend was to gratify thoſe that ſay, <hi>Revelation is ceaſed;</hi> and alſo deny <hi>Revelation</hi> to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Church of Chriſt to the end of the World; which is contrary to Scripture, and the Saints experience. Read <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Romans</hi> 16.26. the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> ſaith, <hi>To the obedience of Faith in all</hi> Gentiles: The other ſaith, <hi>Made known to all</hi> Nations. This I ſuppoſe is alſo to gratify thoſe that deny Chriſt, <hi>the true Light that enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> whom to obey is <hi>Eternal Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. The <hi>Latin</hi> ſaith, <hi>God ſpake to the Fathers in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and laſt of all ſpake to us IN his Son:</hi> The other ſaith, <hi>God ſpoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, and hath in the laſt days ſpoken to us BY his Son.</hi> Which Tranſlation is to ſet up <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Letter,</hi> to be our Teacher, and to lay aſide <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Saints only Teacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. The <hi>Latin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Leſt any Man be wanting to the Grace of God:</hi> The other, <hi>Leſt any Man fail of the Grace of God.</hi> Which ſeems to deny that the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation (and hath appeared to, and in every Man) to be ſufficient to Salvation. And in the <hi>Margent,</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> ſaith, (on that <hi>Text) If we be not good, there is no lack on God's part, who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45369:13"/>offereth his Grace freely to all; the defect is in our ſelves, that anſwer not God's calling by his Grace.</hi> Which I take to be ſound <hi>Orthodox</hi> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jude</hi> 14. The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> hath it, <hi>Our Lord is come [in] his holy Thouſands, that numberleſs number, which no Man can number:</hi> The other ſaith, <hi>The Lord cometh [with] ten thouſands of his Saints.</hi> Which doubtleſs is to countenance a carnal perſonal appearance of Chriſt at his ſecond coming, who as he went, a Cloud recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him out of their ſight; even ſo in the like manner ſhall he return in a Cloud of Witneſſes in his holy Thouſands. <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.10. The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> hath it, <hi>And I ſaid to the Angel that ſpake [in] me:</hi> The other, <hi>I ſpake to the Angel that talked [with] me.</hi> Which later Tranſlation moſt aſſuredly was to gratify them that deny Chriſt (God's Angel) to come in the Fleſh of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. The <hi>Latin</hi> hath it; <hi>Who according to his great Mercy hath regenerated us into an Inheritance that cannot fade, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Heavens [in] you:</hi> The other ſaith, <hi>Reſerved in the Heavens [for] you.</hi> This likewiſe I apprehend is to gratify that Spirit which denies Chriſt to be in the Saints, and Heaven to be there where Chriſt is, which Spirit I take to be the Spirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe read and conſidered the <hi>Arguments, Annotations, Tables,</hi> and other helps, for the better underſtanding of the Text, which I find in Divine things both uſeful and profitable. As for Example;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annotation</hi> before the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the whole Sacred Bible is a ſealed Book, and not rightly underſtood till the Seals be opened by the Key of God's Spirit:</hi> And you ſay, on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. <hi>The Scriptures, beſides the literal Senſe, have a more deep, ſpiritual, and allegorical Senſe, not to be underſtood but by the ſame Spirit that writ them.</hi> And you alſo ſay, That <hi>there is no way to know Canonical Scriptures but by the Church:</hi> Which is a Truth, if you mean the Spirit of Chriſt in the Sanctified; which Sanctified are the only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45369:13"/>true Church of Chriſt. You alſo ſay, The <hi>only difference between the</hi> Old <hi>and</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>is, that in the</hi> Old <hi>lies hid the</hi> New <hi>by an Allegory;</hi> Which is a Truth, to him that hath an Ear to hear what the Spirit in the Letter ſaith. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8. you ſay, <hi>The words</hi> Imputed, <hi>or</hi> Reputed, <hi>do not diminiſh the Truth of Juſtice, and that Juſtice is not reputed to them that are not made Juſt and Righteous;</hi> Which is alſo a moſt real Truth.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. you ſay, <hi>There is as much difference betwixt Chriſt's Divinity and his Humanity, as was between</hi> Iſaac <hi>and the</hi> Ram, <hi>and as is 'twixt Eleſh and Spirit, for what is born of Fleſh is Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Book <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> you ſay, <hi>teacheth to contemn this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil World; and that things Earthly and Senſual are inſufficient to give Peace and Reſt to our Souls; and that true Felicity conſiſteth not in Natural Knowledg, gotten by Wit and Natural Induſtry; nor in Riches, Honour, Pleaſures, nor in Authority or Dominion, nor in any thing that is Senſual or Carnal, but only in the Eternal and Internal fruition of God in our Souls, which is procured by Free Grace, which enables us to decline Vices, and to purſue the ways of Vertue, which lead to Beatitude;</hi> all which are Truths moſt clear and excellent. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before</hi> Leviticus, <hi>in which Book</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Jerome) all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> Aaron<hi>'s Veſtments, and the whole</hi> Levitical <hi>Order (almoſt every Syllable) breaths forth Heavenly Sacraments;</hi> I ſay, even as the whole Creation doth breath forth God's Omnipotence, his Grace and loving Kindneſs to Mankind. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.3. When the Scripture ſaith <hi>Convert, &amp;c.</hi> we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed that <hi>we have Free-Will;</hi> and when we anſwer, <hi>Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we ſhall be converted,</hi> we confeſs that God's Grace preventeth or enableth us; and when he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any good of us, it is either to humble or enable us in the performance, as <hi>James</hi> 1.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. which Doctrine is true, for we have no other free-will to good, but what God giveth us, in, by, and through his Holy Spirit of Grace, which appears to and in every Man. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45369:14"/>On <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. you ſay, <hi>The New Creature is the true Faith and Work of Grace in the Hearts of the Faithful, and is the Faith firſt delivered to and in the Saints.</hi> A Speech moſt true. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. you ſay, <hi>No Man can ſay Jeſus is our Lord, but by his Spirit within us;</hi> which enableth us to be obedient to his Commands, and to do the Will of God here on Earth, as it is in Heaven: for by Chriſt ſtrengthening us, we can do all things pleaſing to God our Heavenly Father. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. you ſay, <hi>Grace is the only means enabling us to ſerve and pleaſe God.</hi> Tit. 2.11. <hi>And that Man's free-Will is begot, and worketh freely by free-Grace.</hi> Alſo, you ſay, <hi>Free-Will is in Man, for that no Sin can be committed without conſent of free-Will; nor can any Work merit or pleaſe God, but what is wrought in Man by the free Grace of God's Holy Spirit:</hi> Thus by Grace we are ſaved, not of our ſelves, it is the free Gift of God to every one. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Elias is alive, and ſhall be a fore-runner of Chriſt's ſecond coming.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Elias</hi> in Spirit is alive, and now preacheth Repentance, and forgiveneſs of Sins, to all that amend their Lives according to God's Holy Word, written in every Man's Heart, (the Volumn of God's Book, wherein his Will is known) that <hi>it may be done here on Earth as in Heaven.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>You ſay alſo, <hi>That</hi> Enoch <hi>is yet alive, and ſhall preach in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's time with</hi> Elias. This is alſo a Truth, if you ſpeak this of the Spirit of God that was in <hi>Enoch;</hi> for as <hi>Elias</hi>'s Spirit, in <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s Time, preached Repentance, and forgiveneſs of Sins, to all that truly repented and forſook their Sins, (preparing the way for Chriſt to be begot and born in us); So did that Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> preach Repentance to the Diſobedient in the days of <hi>Noah.</hi> As in this day the ſame Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> preacheth Repentance to all that are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; Even ſo likewiſe <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> in Spirit is alive, who ſhall, and now doth, as you ſay, <hi>preach in Antichriſt's time:</hi> for Chriſt, the Word incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the Reſurrection and the Life, is now preaching in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45369:14"/>Sanctified, the Reſurrection from the Dead, to and in all that have bin <hi>crucified with Chriſt,</hi> and are <hi>riſen with him from the Death of Sin to the Life of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>Which Word Incarnate, or Word in the Heart, is <hi>God's Preacher to all the World,</hi> and is the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> preached for the Obedience of Faith, to and in all Nations, and all Religions whatſoever, ſo that all Men may believe, and by obeying may be ſaved. Amen. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> As it is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, to the 15. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, to the 9th. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Job</hi> 36.11, 12.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Chriſt in Soul deſcended into Hell to deliver all juſt Men:</hi> Which is a Truth, if you mean <hi>Chriſt in Spirit</hi> (as he is the <hi>Light of the World) deſcends into every Man's unclean heart to cleanſe and purifie it,</hi> and ſo leads Captivity captive, bringing the Souls of the Faithful (once dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins) out of Death, out of the Grave, out of Hell, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, where they ſit and ſing <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Sin is always the cauſe of Reprobation:</hi> Which is alſo a Truth moſt clear, for it is our Sins that ſeparate us from God, and with-hold good things from us: And in our Obedience or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Word of God in our Hearts, ſtands Life and Death, Election and Reprobation; for according to their Works ſhall <hi>every one receive, whether they do good, or evil.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. you ſay, <hi>The New Man is an inherent quality of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs in our Souls; and not only an Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but a Work of God's free Grace, enabling the Faculties of our Souls, to work freely the thing that is good and righteous:</hi> A Truth moſt clear and excellent. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Cor. 1.5. you ſay, <hi>All the Saints Sufferings and Afflictions are Chriſt's Sufferings, by reaſon of the Conjunction and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that is betwixt Chriſt the Head, and the Sanctified his Members.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Adam was created in Grace and Innocency, which he loſt only by Diſobedience, yet by Repentance is ſaved.</hi> And thus it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45369:15"/>is with all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> He that ſins againſt the Light of Chriſt in his Conſcience, eats the forbidden Fruit, and ſo ſins after <hi>the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſgreſſion; and is not ſaved out of Tranſgreſſion, but by Repentance,</hi> and laying hold of God's Spirit of Grace, which obeying, brings through <hi>the flaming Sword, or Sword of the Spirit,</hi> that <hi>turns every way to cut down Sin and Iniquity in whomſoever it is found;</hi> ſo that <hi>no unclean thing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Kingdom of Heaven, or eat of the Tree of Life placed in the midst of God's Paradiſe, (the Hearts of the Sanctified)</hi> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>The Church of Chriſt is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, and conſists of all Nations:</hi> So ſay I, (as I am a Prieſt of God to the Nations, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt Jeſus in me, my Prieſt, my Prophet, and my King) that amongſt all Nations, all Sects, and ſorts of Religions, whatſoever they be called, <hi>Jews, Barbarians, Heathens,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſuch as walk in the <hi>Light of the Lord,</hi> wherewith <hi>every one is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are accepted with him, and they are God's Temple and Church, in whom he dwells.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>The Children of the Church are the Spiritual Seed of</hi> Abraham; Which Seed, I ſay, is Chriſt, who dwells in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies of the Saints, who convinceth of Sin, and ſanctifies them from committing Sin, ſo that where <hi>two or three are met in his Name,</hi> (his <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi>) there is He in the midſt of them, and thus is He with his Body the Church, to the end of the World. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clergie Men,</hi> you ſay, <hi>ought not to ſerve for temporal Rewards, and that they may not exerciſe that Holy Function for filthy Lucre:</hi> And ſo ſay I, that thoſe that Preach and Pray what is preſcribed them by Man for Temporal Rewards, are not the Miniſters of Chriſt, but Anti-chriſts Miniſters: for the Miniſters of Chriſt, as they receive the Spirit of Grace (Chriſt the New Covenant, the Word in the Heart) freely, ſo they give freely, and not for filthy Lucre, but from a ready and willing mind, to the ſaving of Souls, and not for gaining the Fleece. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45369:15"/>You ſay, <hi>Jews ſhall be converted at the end of the World.</hi> I ſay, As the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are converted, ſo are the <hi>Jews,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obey God's Covenant of Light, the free Gift of God, the Word in the Heart, the New Covenant, God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>A Conſcience guilty of Sin, tormenteth the Sinner.</hi> So ſay I, That the <hi>Light of Chriſt,</hi> wherewith <hi>every one is enlightned, being diſobeyed, is the Tormentor and the Condemnation,</hi> read <hi>John</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Myſteries of Chriſt are</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>high things above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Capacities.</hi> So ſay I, for <hi>the Natural Man perceiveth not the things of God, which are only ſpiritually diſcerned;</hi> Therefore I adviſe all unregenerate Men (not born again of the Spirit, which quickneth and createth the New Man in us) in that ſtate, not to meddle with the things of God (as <hi>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt two of theſe ſixteen Books I have read with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation of Mind, which I apprehend were written by a Divine Spirit, and do recommend them to all that are partakers of the Divine Nature. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The five next I apprehend to be written by Wiſe Men, lovers of Wiſdom, and well worth the reading by Men of Knowledg and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The laſt nine I apprehend were written to ſet forth and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Faith and Church, to maintain by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſpute, That the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only True Church of Chriſt, and all others that differ from her are <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> good for nought but to be deſtroyed in Body and Soul: concerning which, I do moſt humbly crave leave to examine, by the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45369:17"/>intending, what I find to proceed from God's Holy Spirit of Truth, (which are the Things of God) to treaſure up in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Storehouſe; the reſt, proceeding from Man unregenerate in the fall, meerly humane, and what was learnt of Man in the Schools, or from the Letter, I intend to return back again, as your own Mony in your own Sacks.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I muſt needs commend the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Spirit of him that wrot <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> who ſaith, He was bettered by reading <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts</hi> Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhews him a Man that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Truth from any Man, or Sect, <hi>try all things,</hi> and I hope, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and hold fast that which is good in every Man of all Religions.</hi> Further, he ſaith, <hi>All Sects, maintaining their own Opinion, none condeſcending to others, deſtroy all Love and Charity; which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no Religion is any thing worth; but in Charity, Love, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>all Sects are pleaſed.</hi> Alſo, he ſaith, <hi>Difference for Opinions is neither pious nor rational.</hi> He alſo ſaith, <hi>That none is fit to judg of all Sects, that is of Any; nor is the</hi> Atheiſt <hi>meet.</hi> Further, he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt (or Charity, the Love of God) being departed, all Forms of Religion are but a meer Romance.</hi> He alſo ſaith, <hi>Truth is found in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, not in Diviſion.</hi> And I ſay, Till all come to the Unity of the Spirit, given to every Man to profit with, there can never be Unity. Alſo he ſaith, <hi>That the Soul of Man is Immortal, Intelligible, and Rational; and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Love, and Charity, is the Image of God in Man; and that right Reaſon doth not caſt away Chriſt, but is one with him:</hi> Alſo, <hi>Whoſoever brings to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is bleſt, though but an Owl, (or Fool, as the Spirits Preaching is accounted fooliſhneſs by unregenerate Men).</hi> Alſo he ſaith, <hi>All Sects fight againſt each other till</hi> Chriſt <hi>be ſet up, the Teacher in all.</hi> Theſe and the like I take to be Maxims of Truth, meet to be conſidered and received.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers aſſert, The <hi>Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>to be Head of the</hi> Church of Chriſt <hi>here on Earth, and</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s Vicar, as being</hi> Peter<hi>'s Succeſſor, on whoſe Perſon</hi> (you ſay) Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> Church <hi>is built, proved out of</hi> Matth. 16.16, 17. To which I make return, and ſay, That <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon was not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45369:17"/>the Rock whereon Chriſt's Church is built; but the Spirit of God, which revealed to <hi>Peter</hi> the things of God, as will moſt evidently appear by the Reaſons following, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, For <hi>that no Man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son revealeth him,</hi> Mat. 11.27. Gal. 1.12, 16. 1 Cor. 2.10. 1 Pet. 1.13. So it is the Revelation of God the Father, gives the Knowledg of God the Son; and it is the Spirit of Chriſt in the Saints, revealing the Father and the Son, which is the Rock whereon Chriſt's Church is built, <hi>againſt which the Gates of Hell can never prevail,</hi> Matth. 16.17.</p>
            <p>Beſides, had the Church bin built on <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon, had it not fallen into Hell when <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon became Satan, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to Chriſt, and againſt him? when he <hi>ſavoured more the Things of Man than the things of God?</hi> read <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.23. and this was after <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith (the Revelation of God) was called the Rock.</p>
            <p>And what became of the Church, and <hi>Peter</hi> the Rock, when <hi>Peter</hi> denied and forſwore his Maſter? <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.69, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had not then the Church of Chriſt fallen into Hell, if <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon had bin the Rock whereon it had bin built? And, I pray tell me, What think you had become of the Church of Chriſt, had it bin built on <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon, when <hi>Peter</hi> diſſembled, and would have brought in the Old Law, which ſtood in divers outward Obſervations, (wherein the Kingdom of God doth not conſiſt)? And was not this to bring in the firſt Covenant, and to deny Chriſt come in the Fleſh, the Second Covenant, Chriſt the Word in the Heart, and Revelation of God in <hi>Peter</hi> before his Fall, which is the Rock God builds his Church on, againſt whom the <hi>Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail?</hi> but when a Church ſavours the Things of Man more than the things of God, the <hi>Gates of Hell will ſurely prevail against that Church.</hi> And this Revelation of God, was the Rock before <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon was, and before his Fall was, and after his Fall was, and is that Rock whereon all the People of God ſtand, and are built <hi>an Habitation through the Spirit for God to dwell in.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45369:18"/>And do not you think St. <hi>Paul</hi> (that great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) did well in withſtanding and reproving <hi>Peter</hi> to his Face, even in the face of all the Congregation, for endeavouring to bring in ſuch a Hereſy and Schiſm into the Church of Chriſt, as to withdraw from the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſet up the Obſervations of the Old Law, which ſtood in outward things, which was to deny Chriſt the New Law, the Word of Grace in the Heart, <hi>God's everlaſting Covenant of Light and Life to Jew and Gentile?</hi> which certainly was and is a moſt pernicious Doctrine, wherewith all the <hi>Jews</hi> were drawn from the Faith of Chriſt; inſomuch that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was alſo <hi>led aſide by their diſſimulation.</hi> And for thoſe who had run well, and begun in the Spirit, for them to imagine they ought to be made perfect by the Obſervation of things outward and carnal, was a moſt damnable Hereſy (which <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> firſt begun); to divide the Church of God, the Head from the Members, was doubtleſs a great Schiſm, and falling <hi>from the true Faith, firſt delivered to the Saints,</hi> which ſtood in the <hi>Revelation of</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Spirit's teaching.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt bid <hi>Peter, feed my Sheep,</hi> you ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> received Supremacy over the reſt of the Apoſtles, and was made General Paſtor of the Church. And where Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, I will give thee the Keys of Heaven; and what thou bindeſt in Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and what thou looſeſt on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> Was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Key, think you, Carnal, or any thing elſe but the Revelation of God's Spirit to <hi>Peter</hi> before his Fall, which ſurely is the Key of <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>openeth the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, which no Man can ſhut?</hi> And have not all true Believers (born of the Spirit) the ſame Key and Authority to bind and looſe, as <hi>Peter</hi> had? read <hi>John</hi> 20.22, 23. So that you ſee the Power of the Keys, and the feeding Chriſt's Sheep, ſtands in receiving the Holy Ghoſt, and not in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon, as <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf afterwards confeſſed; read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. ſaying to the Diſciples, <hi>Feed the Flock of God which is among you, over which the Holy Ghoſt is Overſeer; not by conſtraint, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45369:18"/>willingly; not for filthy Lucre-ſake, but voluntarily; and not as Lords over God's Heritage, but as Examples, even as Chriſt was to his Followers,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and humble of Heart, and ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls.</hi> So Holy Jeſus by his Doctrine and Example, did not give <hi>Peter</hi> Lordly Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over the reſt of his Diſciples, but ſaid otherwiſe to them that deſired Supremacy and Lordſhip over the reſt, <hi>Be not called of Men Maſters, nor ſeek the uppermoſt Seats at Feaſts, nor greetings in the Market-place: Seek not Supremacy nor Authority over your Brethren; for he that would be greateſt among you, ſhall be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto all.</hi> Thus you ſee Chriſt gave no Supremacy to <hi>Peter,</hi> for Supremacy and Lordſhip is what the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> exerciſe over one another; and that which <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> (who ſlew his Maſter <hi>Mauricius</hi>) gave to <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, <hi>i.e.</hi> Supremacy for ſetting him up Emperor. So you ſee Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is not the Doctrine of Chriſt, but the Gift of the <hi>Gentiles, Emperors,</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi> And though many Graces at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Church, yet the greateſt and ſupreameſt Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were Humility and Charity. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I am a Prieſt to God (having Chriſt Jeſus in me) ſent to try what Spirit governs the World, my hearts deſire to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, That they would try and examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Rule of God's Spirit, whether they ſtand upon Chriſt the Rock, the Revelation of God to <hi>Peter, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereon all the Faithful ſtand and are built, the Rock of Ages throughout all Generations?</hi> Or whether they are built on <hi>Peter</hi>'s Perſon in his Degeneration and Fall, when he denied and left the Rock, by ſavouring and <hi>ſetting up the Things of Man above the Revelation of God, the only thing needful to make a true Chriſtian?</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>I humbly crave leave further to query and ask, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> affirming <hi>Mary</hi> (a Creature, eſpouſed to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>) to be the Mother of God, who is infinite, whether this be not Blaſphemy? read <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.47, to 50. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.48. <hi>John</hi> 2.4. and to worſhip or adore her Image, Similitude, or Picture,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45369:19"/>whether this be not a breach of the Second Commandment, and the higheſt Idolatry, ſeeing to worſhip or adore the Work of Man's hand, is worſe Idolatry than to worſhip and adore the meaneſt Creature that God hath made?</p>
            <p>And you calling the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (a Creature) Head of Chriſt's Church, is not this, think you, Blaſphemy? And for you to call Bread and Wine (meer Creatures) after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, our Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer (who is the Bread of Life, that came from Heaven) is not this think you alſo Blaſphemy? and for you thus to adore and worſhip theſe Creatures, is not this, think you, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</p>
            <p>Likewiſe to call a Crucifix of Man's making, the Croſs of Chriſt, which is the Power of God, that crucifies Sin, and the Luſt of the Fleſh in the Saints, is not this (think you) a high Crime of Blaſphemy? And to worſhip and adore this Creature of Man's making, is not this, think you, the higheſt Idolatry? feeing you own falling down, adoring, and worſhiping, to be all one and the ſame thing. And for a Man to make an Altar, and bow to it, is not this the worſt kind of Idolatry, thus to worſhip a Creature of Man's making more than the Power of God, Chriſt, the Word (revealed) in the Heart? <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For you to ſet up <hi>Holy Dayes,</hi> and obſerve <hi>Saints Days,</hi> is not this (think you) a Preſcription and Impoſition of Man, and not by God's Command? and may not we call all theſe days of Man's making the <hi>Devil's Days</hi> (as Jeſus called <hi>Peter, Satan,</hi> when he ſavoured more the things of Man than the things of God) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <hi>Saints Days,</hi> who ſerved God in the Spirit of Truth every Day? So he that <hi>keeps a Day holy to the Lord doth well, but he that keeps a day in ſatisfaction of the Fleſh, in Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Wantonneſs, doth ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have bin credibly informed, that in <hi>Ireland</hi> the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> keep St. <hi>Patricks</hi> and St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, with more Debauchery and Drunkenneſs than any other day in the Year; and I am ſure, in <hi>England,</hi> Holy-Days uſed to be kept and celebrated more to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45369:19"/>the honour of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than to the Service of the only holy true God. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Chriſt's Church is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, and always viſible.</hi> I ſay, Chriſt's Church is and ever was <hi>inviſible</hi> to Men unregenerate, who are not born of the Spirit, (tho never ſo wiſe and prudent in natural Things): I pray, where was the Church viſible when <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, and the reſt of his Diſciples forſook him and fled? <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.56. And do not you think that theſe things were written for our Example, that we ſhould not follow Man, nor the things of Man (in the Unregenerate Eſtate) in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but the gracious holy Spirit of God in our Selves, which whoſoever hath not, is no true Chriſtian? Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. which Spirit is the Saints only Teacher. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I pray, where was the Church of Chriſt viſible, when St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw her (as on Eagles Wings) flee into the Wilderneſs to ſave her ſelf from the uſurpation and tyranny of the falſe Church, <hi>for a time, times, and half a time?</hi> where ſhe was ſeen and known only to God, fed, and nouriſhed by him, not with viſible Bread, but with Bread and Water of Life from Heaven, (the true Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt) of which the National Viſible Church knoweth nothing, which only feed upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carnal viſible Things, ſuch as the Traditions, Preſcriptions, and Impoſitions of Men prepare for them: So that all this time the True Church and Spouſe of Chriſt lay hid in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a mourning Widow, a City unbuilt, troden under-foot of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> cloathed in Sackcloth, whilſt the viſible falſe Church ſat as a Queen upon the many Waters: <hi>Which Waters,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, were Peoples, Multitudes, Nations, Tongues, and Kindreds, whereon the Whore and falſe Prophets ſat, cloathed in Purple and Scarlet, and deckt with Gold and precious Stones; in ſo much that all the World wondred, and worſhipped the Whore and falſe Prophet, ſhe having a golden Cup in her hand, full of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Man's Inventions, which ſhe gave to drink to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the Tongues, even to all the People that received the Mark of the Beaſt, and Number of his Name,</hi> (what the Civil Magiſtrate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45369:20"/>impoſed) <hi>on whom the Whore and falſe Prophet ſat:</hi> To ſuch ſhe filled of her Cup, and received them within the Pale of her Church; but for thoſe that refuſed to drink of her abominable Cup, and to receive the Mark of the Beaſt, and Number of his Name, (which Number ſtands in things of Man's impoſing) againſt ſuch, the Beaſt, Whore, and falſe Prophet, proclaimed War, and would neither Buy nor Sell with them, but made Laws, and perſecuted the True Church, and Members of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Laws made by Man, many a thouſand even to death. And this came to paſs, that the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> might be fulfilled, who ſaw the Beaſt, (the <hi>Roman Monarch</hi>) ſhould have <hi>power to ſcatter, to deſtroy, and to make deſolate the Holy City, and Holy People, for a time, times, and half a time;</hi> which time is, <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty days;</hi> and taking a Year for a day, is, <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty Years.</hi> He that is wiſe, and ſtandeth in his Lot, (as <hi>Daniel</hi> did in the meaſure of God's Holy Spirit, the Lot of God's Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) knoweth the meaning of the Spirit in thoſe deep myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hidden Things of God; in which Spirit it is ſeen, that <hi>the time, times, and half a time is accompliſhed,</hi> that the Church of Chriſt is to ſtay in the Wilderneſs, who is <hi>coming out of her Wilderneſs condition,</hi> out of her <hi>mourning Sackcloth,</hi> as a <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of Stars upon her Head,</hi> (the Faithful, Choſen, and truly Sanctified) and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Moon</hi> (all inferior and borrowed Lights) <hi>under her Feet,</hi> where the Citizens of <hi>Sion,</hi> the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> have no need of a Candle, (or any teaching of Man) for the Lord God by his Inſpiration is their Light; and they need no other Light, but as the Unction, the anointing teacheth them, and is the true Inward and Infallible Teaching, in which Light of the Lord God, the Nations, that are ſaved, walk. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee when, how, and by whom the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from the true Faith and Church of Chriſt came in, and wherein it ſtill ſtandeth, even <hi>in ſavouring</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> did) <hi>the things of Man, more than the things of God,</hi> the inſpiration of his bleſſed holy Spirit. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45369:20"/>And this <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> appeared in the Apoſtles days, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was the Ring-leader, as may be ſeen <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. when <hi>Peter</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and forſook Chriſt (his Spirit) the Rock, the True Church and Faith, the Corner-Stone, the ſure Foundation of the True Church throughout all Generations, God's Covenant of Light to all the World, and his Salvation to the Ends of the Earth; his Talent, and Meaſure of his Holy Spirit of Grace, given to every one to profit with; in the which diſobeying ſtands our Condemnation, and in obeying of it ſtandeth our eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Peace and Reſt with God. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by <hi>Peter</hi>'s bad Example, the Church of Chriſt had like to have bin loſt in the Apoſtacy, had not St. <hi>Paul</hi> (that great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) ſtood in the Gap, in withſtanding <hi>Peter</hi> ſo boldly to his very Face, for this his diſſimulation; which did not only draw away the <hi>Jews,</hi> but <hi>Barnabas.</hi> was alſo carried away by their diſſimulation; by their compelling the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to live as did the <hi>Jews,</hi> they brought a great Schiſm into the Church, and had like, even at that time, to have carried the whole Church into the Apoſtacy, had not St. <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood them. Which Apoſtacy afterwards came in by obſerving the Old Law, and other Heatheniſh Cuſtoms preſcribed by Man, rather than the Commands of God: For did not the Apoſtacy come in by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of Days, Months, Times, and Years; by obſerving Holy Days, New-Moons, and Sabbath-Days, (or <hi>Sundays,</hi> ſo called from the <hi>Heathens)?</hi> read <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 16, 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20. What ado was there about the keeping of <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> of outward <hi>Circumciſion, Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Supper?</hi> all which were but Figures of the Inward: What Quarreling and Diſputes were there, even in the Apoſtle's days, about theſe Matters; and ſoon afterwards between the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and thoſe of one <hi>Subſtance,</hi> concerning the Nature and Being of Chriſt? one Biſhop thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out another, and killing one another about theſe outward Things of Man's ſetting up; ſuch things wherein the Kingdom of God is not found, nor the Church of Chriſt edified, but much Blood ſpilt, and Humility, Love, and Charity loſt, in theſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45369:21"/>bitter Diſputes and Conteſts, and all about ſuch beggarly Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe; which no ways did benefit the Church, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, in ſo much that thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> were worſe than the <hi>Heathens</hi> in Converſation, and more like their Father the Devil, than the Children of God, or Brethren of Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Apoſtacy increaſed and waxed ſtrong, by <hi>ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the things of Man, more than the things of God,</hi> then came in the Abomination which made deſolate, the Obſervation of <hi>Chriſtmaſs-day, Whitſunday,</hi> &amp;c. and other Saints days, both <hi>Feaſting</hi> and <hi>Faſting-days;</hi> keeping of <hi>Lent;</hi> preſcribing what Meats ſhould be eaten, and what not. About this time came in alſo <hi>Altars,</hi> made with mens hands, and brought into the Church to worſhip God withal, which in the Old Law was but a ſhadow of Chriſt in the Saints, the New Law; which <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> God pitched in Man, and is God's Workmanſhip, and not the Work of Man's hand.</p>
            <p>And did not the Apoſtacy bring in the <hi>Seven Sacraments,</hi> viz. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which ſtood in the outward Element of Water, in the place of <hi>Chriſt's Baptiſm,</hi> which conſiſteth in the operation of the Holy Ghoſt in the Saints, the which cleanſeth from Sin, and begets the New Man, Chriſt, in them, their Hope and Glory? <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did not alſo the Sacrament of the <hi>Altar</hi> come in with the Apoſtacy, conſiſting of carnal Bread and Wine, which are but Creatures, turned (you ſay) by the Prieſt's Conſecration, into the Real Body and Blood of Chriſt? whereas the Real Body of Chriſt is not Carnal nor Elementary, but the true Blood that came from Heaven, the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, the Vine, and is the true Wine that chears the heart of God and Man? Read <hi>Judges</hi> 9.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. <hi>John</hi> 6, 51, 63. which Bread and Wine, whoſoever eateth and drinketh, <hi>ſhall live for ever,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door, and knock, if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door</hi> (of the Heart) <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>come in to him, and Sup with him, and he with me.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45369:21"/>Which Supper is not an outward carnal eating and drinking, as the falſe Church ſuppoſeth, but is a Spiritual eating and drinking, to receive Chriſt into our Hearts, and feed on him there, which nouriſheth the Soul up into Eternal Life. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> Read <hi>John</hi> 6.27, 33, 48, 51, 57, 63. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.</p>
            <p>The other Five Sacraments, as <hi>Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Marriage, Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> are theſe, think you, or the two former, more a <hi>Sacrament, Similitude,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of Chriſt; than the meaneſt <hi>Animal</hi> that God hath made? And where doth the Scripture call theſe, or any one of them, a <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Is not Chriſt the <hi>Beginning and End</hi> of all God's Works, figured out by a Lion, a Lamb, yea, by every thing that hath Life? (Is he not the <hi>Roſe of</hi> Sharon, <hi>and the Lilly of the Valleys</hi>) yea, by things that have no Life; For is not <hi>Chriſt the Door and Way to God?</hi> And may not we as well bow down and worſhip God in theſe things, as in any of theſe Seven Sacraments? And to fall down and worſhip, by a Picture, the Image or Likeneſs of <hi>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus bowing or worſhiping God, through the Work of Man's hands, be not the higheſt kind of Idolatry, and contrary to God's Commandment in the Old Law, and much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the New, which is, <hi>to worſhip God in the Spirit of Truth only?</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>I pray, was it not after the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> came in, that Men built Churches, calling them <hi>the Houſe of God, the Church,</hi> and <hi>Temple of God?</hi> and worſhipping God in theſe Temples made with hands, (after the Old Law) and in ſuch outward Obſervations as Man invented, preſcribed, and impoſed, in which God is not found, nor is an outward thing, made by Man, the place of his Habitation? read <hi>Acts</hi> 7.48. But it fareth with falſe Chriſtians in the Apoſtacy, as it did with falſe Jews in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s Time, read <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.14. when <hi>Iſrael had forgotten his Maker, they built Temples,</hi> thinking to pleaſe God in ſo doing (as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do); <hi>But God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands: the true Temple wherein God is pleaſed to dwell, is the ſanctified Heart,</hi> as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45369:22"/>you may read <hi>John</hi> 17.21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. And as your Tranſlation hath it, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt in us:</hi> Such are the only true Church of God, in whom Chriſt dwelleth bodily, who hath now, as ever he had, a Spiritual Body, and makes the Saints, (by a new Birth) even in this World, ſuch as he is in Heaven, read 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when came in <hi>Prayers in an unknown Tongue?</hi> I confeſs, a Zeal there may be in ſuch Service, but without knowledg of what men want, or ask, or feeling of God's Preſence, or Faith in what they ask, nor can there be a hope of Return or Anſwer from God; ſo that ſuch Prayers are altogether vain and fruitleſs, no better than what the <hi>Heathens</hi> make, (that know not God) being preſcribed (as yours are) by their Prieſts and Teachers. A Worſhip invented by Man (wanting the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit) can never find acceptance with God; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our Prayers proceed from a true repentant Heart, from a new Heart, and a right Spirit, which God giveth every Man to profit with, that truly deſires to forſake Sin, and to have Sin pardoned, all other Prayers prevail nothing with God, though never ſo many out of cuſtom, or never ſo good words preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Man, proceeding from an unregenerate Heart, not born again of the Spirt of Love to Truth and Righteouſneſs, as, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us,</hi> or, <hi>Chriſt have Mercy upon us,</hi> or never ſo many <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> or <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, all ſuch Prayers, not proceeding from the Spirit, are accounted by God vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, which he abhors; and he accepts no other Prayers but what proceeds from his own Spirit of Grace, ſuch he accepts, (knowing the meaning of the Spirit) though uttered by a Sigh or a Groan. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when came in <hi>Holy Water, hallowing material Churches, Baptizing of Bells,</hi> with many other ſuch-like <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Obſervations, came not theſe in with the <hi>Apoſtacy?</hi> for in the beginning, (when God's Holy Spirit was the Teacher, Leader, and Sanctifier of the Faithful) it was not ſo. And had not you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45369:22"/>theſe from the <hi>Jews,</hi> or from the <hi>Heathens?</hi> for among true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Worſhip ſtood not in ſuch outward beggarly Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, but in the Spirit of Truth, the Law in the Heart, the New Covenant, which circumciſeth and purifieth the Heart. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> Read <hi>John</hi> 4.21, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>And did not the Name of <hi>Moſt Holy Father the Pope, Chriſt's Vicar, Peter's Succeſſor, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Perſon, the Rook whereon</hi> (you ſay) <hi>Chriſt's Church is built,</hi> came not theſe in with the <hi>Apoſtacy?</hi> And did not the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> create <hi>Lord-Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> made by a carnal Ordinance of Man, and not by the Holy Ghoſt, as all the Miniſters of Chriſt ever were?</p>
            <p>And when came in <hi>forbidding to Marry, and ſhutting up in Monaſteries and Nunneries that they ſhould not Marry?</hi> And were it not better to marry, and live chaſt with a Wife, than to burn in Luſt? as I have bin credibly informed by ſome Merchants that lived in <hi>Portugal,</hi> who had ſuch devout <hi>Nuns</hi> to be their Miſtreſſes, as acted thoſe abominable things, both by way of writing, and ſending Signs and Tokens of their burning Luſts to their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as is not fit to be once named among <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And have you not read in <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> how that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Legat,</hi> ſent into <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>married Prieſts,</hi> was himſelf taken in Bed with a Harlot? And is it not better, and a leſs ſin, to marry, than to live in Whoredom, which deſtroys both <hi>Body and Soul?</hi> as it is written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.15. Alſo that abundance of Sculls, and Bones of new-born Children, have bin found in the Motes and Ditches belonging to <hi>Nunneries,</hi> when cleanſed. And is it not therefore (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) the <hi>Doctrine of Devils</hi> that preacheth Marriage (which is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and one of your Sacraments) to be ſinful? and are not ſuch Doctors, and Teachers, (think you) guilty of the Abominations committed in thoſe <hi>Nunneries,</hi> and polluting of their Neighbour's Marriage-Bed by <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friars?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And when came in the <hi>Infallibility of the Pope,</hi> came it not in with the <hi>Apoſtacy?</hi> And why may not the <hi>Pope</hi> be as fallible, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45369:23"/>fall as <hi>Peter</hi> did, by <hi>ſavouring the Things of Man, more than the Revelations of God?</hi> And I have read in <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> that there have bin many wicked Popes, and ſometimes no Pope in <hi>Rome</hi> at all, and at other times three <hi>Anti-Popes,</hi> one againſt the other, endeavouring to murther and deſtroy each other. And did not St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> excommunicate each other? And, I pray, was not the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> without a Head when there was no Pope, as oft it hapned in ſeveral Intervals, as in <hi>Anno</hi> 1243. <hi>Anno</hi> 1272. and <hi>Anno</hi> 1316. And a Church without a Head cannot be Chriſt's Church; nor can any Man, ſave the New Man, (that is born of the Spirit) be Head of Chriſt's Church, whoſe Members are made of Living Stones, Elect and Pretious; And how can that Body live and ſubſiſt, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Head? And if the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> have a wicked Pope (as oft it hapned) for their Head, <hi>that</hi> cannot be Chriſt's Church, for the Head of Chriſt's Church, and his Members (the New Man in the Saints) are all Pure, Holy, and Righteous, even as God the Father is Pure, Holy, and Righteous; and ſuch a Head and Members, as are not Holy and Pure, is the <hi>Falſe Church, the Body of Antichriſt, the Synagogue of Satan, and Children of their Father the Devil, whoſe Works they do, who is their Head, and governs them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when came in <hi>Man's making of Saints, viſiting and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping their Tombs, their Reliques, and Shrines;</hi> ſuch as <hi>Thomas of Becket,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was a great Champion for the <hi>Clergie,</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and a great <hi>Rbel to his Prince?</hi> I pray tell me, Whether any comers to theſe things are made the more holy and perfect by the uſe of them (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conſcience) Or, do they take away the guilt of Sin in the Conſcience, whilſt the Witneſs of God condemns? I ſay, nothing beſides the Grace or Spirit of God in the Heart, the Blood of Chriſt, can give Repentance, and <hi>ſprinkle the Conſcience from dead Works to ſerve the Living God.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>And who brought in <hi>pious Frauds, ſetting forth falſe Miracles, never truly wrought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for pious Ends?</hi> Is not this Man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a Lie, and contrary to the Wiſdom and Truth of God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45369:23"/>And when came in your <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> wherein Books are purged or condemned that ſet forth the Prince's Right over the Clergy in Temporals; alſo expunging out of Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Decrees of Councils, what you like not?</p>
            <p>Who invented the <hi>Maſs-Book, Invocation, and Prayers to the Saints departed, for the Living, and for the Dead?</hi> Were theſe things brought into the Church from the beginning, and by the Command of God, or in the dark night of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> by Man's preſcription, when the falſe Church, the Whore, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ruled, after the True Church was fled into the Wilderneſs, out of the ſight and reach of them that ſought to devour her? And can Prayers prevail with God, that are invented by Man, which do not proceed from the Spirit of God? which Prayer is heard in all that it asketh. But Prayers made by (and proceeding from) Man in the Fall, in the unregenerate ſtate, are an abomination to the Lord: for God heareth not Sinners, but hears and anſwers them only, who (by Chriſt's mediation in our hearts) truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, hate, and forſake their Sin, and who are Regenerate, and born again of his Spirit, and that pray in the Power and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this Spiritual Birth; ſuch, and only ſuch (though in a Groan, or Sigh) God the Father hears, anſwers, and ſhews Mercy unto, according as they deſire. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when was <hi>Purgatory</hi> found out, a Place to <hi>purge the Souls of Men that repent not, but live and die in Treſpaſſes and Sins?</hi> Had ye not this from the <hi>Jews,</hi> or from Man in the Fall? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and ſay, as I am a Prieſt of God in the New Covenant of Grace, That there is no other <hi>Purgatory,</hi> (neither in this World, nor in any other World to come) ſave the Blood of Chriſt, the Lamb of God, ſlain by Sin ever ſince the Foundation of the World; even when <hi>Cain</hi> killed innocent <hi>Abel,</hi> then did Chriſt (who was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was) ſuffer in <hi>Abel;</hi> which Blood of Chriſt (the New Covenant) cries for vengeance againſt and upon all that ſpill it, and upon all that crucifie the Lord of Life, and ſuch as reſiſt and quench God's Holy Spirit of Grace in themſelves, the only one Sacrificer and Mediator between
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45369:24"/>God and Man, the Saints only Redeemer, Sanctifier, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And woe be to them from the Lord God, under whoſe Skirts is found the Blood of the Souls of the poor Innocent, the Church of Chriſt, whom he hath purchaſed, waſhed, and cleanſed with his own Blood, his own Light and Life in themſelves, which the Faithful eat and drink, and is the Blood of Sprinkling, which ſpeaketh better things than did the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> (whoſe Blood crieth for vengeance againſt them that ſpill it): which Blood of Chriſt, God's Spirit of Grace, is that which waſheth and cleanſeth true Believers from all Sin; and which Blood redeems up to God, out of the Fall, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, the Habitation of the Faithful, where God's Honour and Glory dwelleth. Thus God's Spirit only is that which purifieth and redeemeth the Soul from all pollution of Fleſh and Spirit. <hi>Amen.

            <p>And this I have further to ſay to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> both to the <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> That whoſoever amongſt them hath not the Spirit of Chriſt to waſh and cleanſe, and to lead them into Truth and Righteouſneſs, is no true Chriſtian, no true Member of Chriſt's Church; nor can be ſaved, or <hi>inherit the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> as it is written <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. and 12.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
            <p>Who made <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi> ſupplying them with <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> (made by a carnal Ordinance of Man) and ſet forth <hi>Tithes,</hi> forcing the payment of them by carnal Weapons, the Magiſtrate's Sword, (no Goſpel-way of maintenance)?

            <p>Though I take not upon me to know, Whether the preſent <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are Members of Chriſt's Body, whereof himſelf (the Spirit of the Father) is only Head; or the Synagogue of Satan, the Children of the Devil their Father, in whom he rules and guides who do his Work. Yet this I declare, That every one in themſelves may perfectly know whether they belong to the True or Falſe Church, to God or the Devil. If you do but examine your ſelves, Whether Chriſt, the Word in the Heart, the Revelation of God by the Spirit of Truth, the Light of Chriſt, his Spirit of Grace be Head in you, leading you into Truth and Righteouſneſs, bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit? which Fruits are evident: read <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.9.

Now your own ſelves, every one in particular, know
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45369:26"/>theſe things to be Fruits of the Fleſh, proceeding from Man in the Fall, unregenerate, and are Earthly, Senſual, and Deviliſh; And know ye not, <hi>to whom you yield your ſelves Servants to obey, his Servants ye are, whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience to Righteouſneſs?</hi> alſo, <hi>that the Wages of Sin is the death of the Soul; and he that ſoweth to the Fleſh, ſhall reap Corruption: for if ye live after the Fleſh, your Souls ſhall die, but if through the Spirit you mortify the Deeds of the Fleſh, you ſhall live.</hi> Finally, my Brethren, whether the Spirit of God that revealed to <hi>Peter</hi> the Things of God, be Head in you? or, the Spirit of Satan, which Ied <hi>Peter</hi> into the Fall, into the Schiſm, into Hereſy, into the Apoſtacy, be Head, which Spirit is the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the which exalts many Inventions, his Preſcriptions, and Traditions above the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and Revelation of God?

            <p>The Contents hereof I moſt humbly and heartily recommend to your moſt holy Father, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Clergy, (as they will anſwer it at the Day of God's Tribunal,) that they communicate theſe Matters to the Emperor, and to all other Kings, Rulers and Princes, over whoſe Souls God (I hope) by his bleſſed Spirit of Grace hath made them Overſeers; who being born of the Spirit, and having Chriſt Jeſus, the new Man in you, (the only begotten Son of God, the Father in you) go and preach Him to and in all the World, a Saviour to all that believe in him, and that follow him; who is the Light of the World, and doth enlighten every one that comes into the World. Yet know, that no Man can preach truly to the converting of Souls, neither can turn any from Darkneſs to Light, ſave thoſe only that are born of the Spirit, and ſo have Chriſt, the Word in their Hearts, as <hi>Paul</hi> had, and all true Miniſters of Chriſt have. Read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. &amp; 2.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. &amp; 2.6. &amp; 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
            <p>Thus learn to know Chriſt, as all the truly ſanctified know him; not after the Fleſh, as he was the Son of Man; nor after the Letter, which kills; but after the Spirit, which begetteth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45369:30"/>Chriſt, the new Man, in us, who is the only true <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> that takes away the Sins of the World, of all that believe in him, and that ſaves his People from their Sins, (as he did the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.47.) giving and encreaſing Grace in them, working all their Works in them and for them, perfecting Holineſs in all that love his Appearance, which Work of Grace in our Hearts is our Sanctification, Juſtification, and Salvation. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus being faithful to God, in adminiſtring the things of God, (as you receive them from him) on God's Name, and in his Strength, go on, and proſper; convert all Nations to Chriſt, the Word in the Heart, God's Covenant of Light to all the World; to Chriſt, the Rock and Revelation of God to <hi>Peter,</hi> on which his Church is built: which Spirit of Grace gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (when ſhe was ſo much renowned) into Truth and Righteouſneſs; which Spirit of Truth gave St. <hi>Peter</hi> Repentance, and led him out of his Fall (where the Gates of Hell prevailed) into all Truth, and made him an able Miniſter of Chriſt, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; in which Spirit he faithfully ſerved his Maſter, in feeding his Sheep with Spiritual Food, Chriſt, the Bread and Water of Life from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And know, that no Man can pleaſe God, ſave Chriſt, the new Man in the Saints, who is created after the Image of God in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true Holineſs. And the firſt Step towards Heaven, and true Chriſtianity, is to be born of the Spirit; for no Man can pleaſe God, nor go to Heaven, ſave he that came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even the Son of God in Man, which always is in Heaven: Read <hi>John</hi> 3.13. Alſo know, that every Motion in Man's Heart to Good, is the Inſpiration and Revelation of God; as every Motion to Evil proceeds from the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; which Trinity is but one evil Spirit, that rules in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience: for of our ſelves we cannot ſo much as think a good Thought; and without Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Revelation, we can never know God the Father, nor God the Son, but by the Inſpiration of God the Holy Ghoſt.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45369:30"/>Nor can we know or act aright in the things of God, but by the Revelation of his own Spirit, (a meaſure whereof is given to every one to profit withal): Nor can we pleaſe God, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation, but as we are born of his Spirit, and led by his Spirit into Truth and Righteouſneſs; as it is written, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.44. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 12.11. For the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unregenerate Man (tho never ſo knowing in Literature, and other worldly Knowledg, as to pleaſe the Ear and Underſtanding of a Man) knoweth nothing of the things of God, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the Scriptures meaning, nor Goſpel of Chriſt, nor can he preach it; becauſe theſe things are only ſpiritually diſcerned. And he that wanteth this Spirit of God in him, to be his Prophet, his Prieſt, his King, to reveal the things of God, to offer Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Praiſes to God, and to lead into Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is no Miniſter of Chriſt, nor true Chriſtian, neither can ſuch a one ever inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Read, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.10, 24, 45. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.3, 4, 6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11, 12. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. With <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <p>After this manner you having Chriſt the Bread and Water of Life in you, then may you feed Chriſt's Lambs, otherwiſe not; and your ſelves being converted and turned from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Chriſt the Light, (in your ſelves) then you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert others, elſe not: And all that profeſs themſelves to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, be ſure you feel God's Spirit to be your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, both to begin and carry on that Work, elſe all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Praying will be but vain, and you cannot profit the People at all, but muſt lie down in ſorrow under all your own Kingdlings and Conceivings, either from the Letter, or what you have learned from Man in the Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus you having Chriſt the Truth in your ſelves, being born of the Spirit, he will teach you to preach Truth, and lead you into all Truth, to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45369:31"/>ſaving not only of your own Souls, but alſo of the Souls of thoſe that hear you. Even ſo, <hi>Amen. Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is but one thing needful to make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as much renowned now as ever, which is, That all forſake the Wiſdom of the Fleſh, and walk in the Wiſdom of the Spirit of Grace, the Word in the Heart, given to every one (of all Religions) to be their Teacher, and Leader into the Way of Truth and Righteouſneſs. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>

            <p>Thus there are and have bin in all Ages, and of all Opinions and Religions, Witneſſes of Chriſt's Birth, who are begotten and born again of the Spirit, which crucifieth Sin in us; and of his Reſurrection, which createth the New Man in us: in which Body of Chriſt, (the Spirit of Light which came from Heaven) the Sanctified ariſe and aſcend into Heaven, and there ſit (even whilſt their Mortal Bodies are here on Earth) at the right Hand of God the Father, in the Unity and Fellowſhip of Chriſt the Son, and Bleſſed Spirit, where are Pleaſures for ever-more. <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah.</hi> Read <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Job</hi> 36.12.</p>

            <p>In the Year 1656, feeling the Birth of God in me, by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, wherein <hi>I was made a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Which Spirit of Light begot Chriſt Jeſus the New Man in me; by whom I obtained Reconciliation and Peace with God, and good will towards all his Creation. Which Spirit of Love moved in me, in the Year 1666, to ſend <hi>Thirty pounds</hi> to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed amongſt the Poor of the <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtant Church,</hi> as a ſign of my dear love and good will to them. Not as <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed his Maſter into the hands of Sinners for <hi>thirty pieces of Silver,</hi> but as from one, that witneſſed the Reſurrection of Chriſt, who had bin dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, whoſe Soul was raiſed out of the Grave of Sin and Death, wherein it had long lain. Thus by the Incarnation or Indwelling of the Life of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45369:32"/>Chriſt Jeſus in my mortal Fleſh, I came to inherit Life Eternal, by and through him that is the Regeneration, the Reſurrection, and the Life. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> By which Spirit of Grace I came to ſee (what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw) that of all Religions, Thoſe that feared God, and acted Righteouſly towards Man, are accepted with him; as it is written, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. Through which Grace I came to underſtand the great Love of God to the World; that (in all Ages and Times) he hath given and ſent his only begotten Son, his Spirit of Light and Grace, into the World; his Everlaſting Covenant of Light and Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he doth enlighten every one (<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi>) that comes into the World; that ſo all Men might be ſaved by believing in him, and by following of him, that is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life of God:</hi> who is God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth; as you may read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 38.11, to 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, to 35. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, 6. By which Spirit of Light, Life, and Truth in the Inward Parts, (the Word in the Heart) moving on the face of my Deep, and ſhining on my Tabernacle, (which God pitched in me); I ſay, I in the ſame Light found freedom to look into all manner of Opinions and Religions; even in that Light which ſhewed me Good from Evil, Right from Wrong, and Truth from Error. In which Spirit of Light, I read many Books writ by <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtants, viz.</hi> ſomething of Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall;</hi> but moſt of Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylors,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammonds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleets,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſons,</hi> with divers others of like kind; Which Books I read with delight, having unity with them, feeling the Spirit of Love to Truth and Righteouſneſs to be their Dictator; which Spirit of Grace, taught them to deny Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, to live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World, which made them honourable in this World, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the World to come. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reading of which Books, I took notice of many worthy and true Sayings, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Great Exampler</hi> ſaith, <q>That Chriſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45369:32"/>Jeſus is our Example, in his Birth, Life, and Death. Alſo (what I have read in Ancient Fathers) that Diſputes amongſt Chriſtians, is the ſcab of the Church, and deſtroys Charity, which only edifies. That God's Will and Commandments are made known in all Mens Spirits, that they may do them. The Word Incarnate is God's Preacher to all the World. That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is nothing elſe but a Reſtorer of the perfect Law of Nature; for God gave Man at firſt a reaſonable intelligible Nature, both to love and ſerve him. That Man's Original Sin was to leave God the Good, and go to the Creature the Evil. Man may keep or break the Law of Nature, ſo ſin againſt God, his Neighbour, and Himſelf. Well-being is, when right Reaſon and the Law of Nature is ſatisfied; and evil Doing, is to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Law of Nature, or right Reaſon, this brings guilt of Conſcience, and torments. And in this Obedience to the Law of Nature conſiſts Heaven, and in Diſobedience, Hell. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is, to worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, and ſo to ſerve our Neighbour. Revelation is both Natural and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; ſo is Self-denial, Death, and Martyrdom, to thoſe that have an Ear to hear the Spirit's Reaſon. Self-denial is but confining the Appetite within the Limits of Nature. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers were commended of old, for preſerving Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Practice, before the School-men, that fight about Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Jeſus his Life was ſweet and affable, and for our Example to Life Eternal. Chriſt, who dwells within the limits of Love, gives us boldneſs with God, and not fear. In Chriſt are two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Body but the upper Garment of the Soul; his Soul was of the ſame Nature and Subſtance with ours, in this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Angels. One Grace ſucceeds another, well preſt, and ſometimes running over, till we come to the fulneſs and ſtature of Chriſt Jeſus, even filled with the Spirit which hath no meaſure, but is Infinite and Eternal. God crowns and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts his Grace in all Sects, even the moſt Heatheniſh, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that, when in Conſcience they worſhip Idols. Original Sin, or one Sin committed, makes us more apt for another;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45369:33"/>ſo we have no cauſe to charge <hi>Adam,</hi> but our ſelves only; every one of us is the <hi>Adam,</hi> the Man of Sin. Obedience unites to God, and conforms to his Will, the which ſanctifies. <hi>Iſaac</hi> offered, is our Heart and Will offered up to God, which he accepts. Nothing ſo able to do Miracles as Love, nor ſo certainly acceptable. All exteriour Acts of Religion to be guided by our Superior, that is, by God only, for no Man in Religion is Superior. No act of Corporal Auſterity, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Religion acceptable to God, unleſs commanded by him. The firſt Baptiſm Appearance, or Reſurrection of Chriſt, is to kill Sin, or to put off Sin. The ſecond Reſurrection, is to put on Chriſt, the New Man, and to walk in him. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more of Man, than to receive and entertain his Grace that appears to every Man. Though the Son of Man hath no where to hide his Head, yet many Houſes to convey his Grace. Grace works Miracles in Saints, as in Chriſt. When Faith and Charity meet, then Chriſtians indeed, and in Truth, all elſe falſe and Antichriſtians. God's Houſe is the ſanctified Heart, where he dwells; and is a Houſe of Prayer for all Nations. Every graceleſs wicked Man is a Devil. No Sin hath Guilt, but when a Man hath Underſtanding and Abilities to do better. By the help of the Spirit, it is poſſible to pleaſe God in all things. One may die for Chriſt's Name, that will not love his Nature, nor quit one evil Luſt for him, this is falſe Martyrdom. The law of Love in our Spirits is the Rule of a Chriſtian, not an outward literal Command, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had. To exceed the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is to be clean within, as in outward Acts. <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> better than <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who tranſgreſs Chriſt's Law, when they will not <hi>Moſes</hi>'s nor <hi>Mahomets.</hi> The clean Soul of a Chriſtian is the Houſe of God, and ſo the Houſe of Prayer, whoſe Body is his Temple. Diſciples did greater Miracles than Jeſus, when Chriſt was riſen in them. Every Man living in the ſtate of Grace, is a perpetual Miracle; ſo our Water is turned into Wine. Chriſt's Father and Mother are not Carnal but Spiritual. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, nor our natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45369:33"/>not imputed to us; neither are our actual and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sins our Infirmities. Vertue conduces infinitely to the length and content of our Lives, and Vice the contrary. 'Tis a vaſt Sum that will pay the Debt of Intemperance and Luſt. Though moſt deny Scripture to be an Allegory, yet all Men in moſt things uſe it ſo, and it is then rightly uſed, when by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we ſee the Heavenly through the Earthly, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual through the Carnal.</q>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:45369:34"/>Likewiſe I have read a Sermon, preached before the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Joſeph Glanvil,</hi> upon <q>
                  <bibl>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.</bibl> 
                  <hi>See that ye love one another.</hi> Wherein are delivered moſt excellent Truths, both <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick;</hi> his deſire is, to unite all Perſwaſions into this Principle of Love; in which Work my Soul hath long travelled.</q> In which Diſcourſe he alſo ſaith, <q>Love is extenſive to all Mankind; and the more General, the more Chriſtian, and like God. To love for Opinion ſake, that is ſelf-Love; but to love the Principle and Image of God, as Chriſt loves the Poor, the Blind, and Ignorant, though his Enemies, is God-like. Alſo, that Love is the Image of God, pourtray'd and lively drawn on the Regenerate Soul. Love is the Bond of Chriſtian Union, and when that breaks, all goes into Confuſion, both in Church and State. Chriſt Reigns, when all unite in the Principle of Love, and a holy Life, which will be the fall of Antichriſt. Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be owned in all Parties and Opinions; and if they were practiſed, it would reconcile all Men to each other. True Religion is not to fill Heads with Notions and Opinions, but to ſow in the Mind the Seed of Vertue, to direct to govern Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to deſtroy Self-will. Chriſtian Love is neceſſary, but agreement in Opinions is neither neceſſary nor poſſible. In eager and paſſionate Diſputes Charity is always loſt, and Truth ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never found. To give evil Names to Diſſenters, is Perſecution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe I have read a Diſcourſe concerning the Knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, and of our Union and Communion with him, made by Mr. <hi>William Sherlock,</hi> who wrote an Anſwer to ſome <hi>new opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Doctors,</hi> (as he calls them) which teach, <q>That by being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Perſon of Chriſt, and rouling themſelves on him, and believing the Hiſtory of his Life, Death, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; that this Faith alone is imputed for Righteouſneſs to them, without having any thing that is good wrought in them by Chriſt, or they doing any thing that is good and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in themſelves. That we are ſaved by Grace, though we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45369:34"/>be diſobedient to the Spirit of Grace, (God's Talent given to every one to profit withal). Alſo they teach, That God hath elected ſome to Salvation, and others to Reprobation, without regard had to Man's Obedience, or Diſobedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, (which Goſpel, is <hi>Chriſt the Word in the Heart,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.)</q> To which, and much more of this nature, Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> maketh anſwer, <q>That the Perſon of Chriſt will never ſave thoſe whom his Goſpel, <hi>(the Word in the Heart)</hi> and their own Conſciences condemn, who walk contrary to his Grace, the Spirit of Light. That Chriſt's Kingdom is erected by conquering Mens Minds, by his Spirit, to the Obedience of God; ſuch, he pardons their ſins, and raiſeth them unto an immortal Life. For this end God ſent his Son (the Word in the beginning) into the World to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, to regenerate and redeem Man to the Obedience of Chriſt, (the Word.) And that nothing avails with God but the New Creature, (which is Chriſt in the Saints) that came to be our Example and Guide to Heaven, as well as our Mediator and Advocate; and therefore we muſt imitate his Life, if we would enjoy the benefit of his Death and Interceſſion. God in the firſt Creation deſigned all Men for happineſs; and certainly in the ſecond Creation, he would have all Men ſaved, and come to the Knowledg of Chriſt the Truth, (the Word in the Heart) by yielding Obedience to Chriſt, his Goſpel, and Spirit of Grace. That nothing can be the happineſs of a reaſonable Creature, but conformity to the Divine Nature. That the great Myſtery of the Recovery of Mankind out of the Fall, conſiſts only in repairing the Divine Image. As in the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were made after God's Image, ſo in the ſecond we are renewed (in the Spirit of our Minds) after his Image; which by Diſobedience we loſt, and is recovered no other way, than by obedience. True expreſſions of Love to Chriſt, is Obedience to his Laws (writ in the Heart.) And that the Soul and Mind of a good Man, (or regenerate Man) is the Palace or Temple of God. That our dying to Sin, is the trueſt conformity to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45369:35"/>Chriſt's Death; and a living to God (in Obedience to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace) is Man's Reſurrection to Life Eternal, and makes us true Subjects of his Kingdom; and this Conformity to Chriſt's Reſurrection, conſiſts in obeying an immortal Principle of Life. Grace and Truth ſignifie the Goſpel of Chriſt, and is God's everlaſting Covenant of Light and Life to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> as ſaith <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.6. <hi>John</hi> 1.4, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4, 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is not an Imputed Righteouſneſs only, but Inherent, which begets the New Man in the Sanctified, which is their Sanctification, Juſtification, and Salvation. The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law conſiſts in an external conformity to the Moral Law; but the Righteouſneſs which is of Chriſt, is an Inherent Righteouſneſs, which exceeds the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and conſiſteth in the renovation of our Minds, in governing the Thoughts and Paſſions, and is therefore called, <hi>our being born again.</hi> We are not living Members of Chriſt, till we ſincerely obey him; and that the only way to pleaſe God, and ſave our Souls, is to follow Chriſt (through the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) who is the Author of Eternal Salvation to them only that obey him. Fellowſhip with God, doth not conſiſt in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Acts, but in a ſtate of Light, Spirit, and Life, in union with Chriſt, conforming us into his Nature and Likeneſs, which makes us the Temple of God, wherein he delights to dwell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (in his <hi>Practical Catechiſm</hi>) ſaith, <q>That <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was accounted the wiſeſt of Men in his time, becauſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed his Knowledg to the Moral part, to the ſquaring and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Mens Lives. Alſo he ſaith, <hi>Gerſon</hi> (a very learned and pious Man) defined Divinity to be an effective, not only a ſpeculative Knowledg: And that the end of Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, is to make Men better, not more learned; to edify, not to inſtruct. That the Law written by God in Man's Heart, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely natural, and teacheth the whole Duty of Man; And Man walking in the Light of God's Law, obtains more light
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45369:35"/>and ſtrength of Grace, but in diſobedience to that Light, Man grows dim and weak. The firſt Covenant <hi>(ſaith the Doctor)</hi> was writ on Stone, which we break. The ſecond Covenant is writ in our Hearts, to ſanctify us, and to lead us into Truth and Righteouſneſs; which Covenant of Grace, Light and Truth, is that which ſaves his People (who walk therein) from their Sins. Which ſecond Covenant is declared and proclaimed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, to 15. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, to 35. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, &amp;c. In this ſecond Covenant of Grace <hi>(ſaith the Doctor)</hi> are contained two Promiſes; Firſt, Of giving more Grace to them that make uſe of their former Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Secondly, Of crowning them with Glory that perſevere in Grace, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> that is, <hi>(ſaith the Doctor)</hi> every Man that walks in this ſecond Covenant of Grace ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for the Grace of God is that which is given to every Man (as a Talent) to profit with. This Grace <hi>(ſaith the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor)</hi> obtains three things for us: Firſt, It gives Repentance, which obtains pardon of Sins paſt. Secondly, It enables them that love it, to pleaſe God in every thing. Thirdly, At the end of our Obedience, it crowns us with an eternal weight of Glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fell</hi> (in the Life of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) ſaith, <q>That exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Vertue muſt reſtore the Church. That Obedience to God's requiring, is the beſt practice. That Unity of Mind, in that which is good, is the greateſt happineſs; and that Sin is to be reſiſted and rejected in the firſt Motion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By all which, it doth manifeſtly appear, That in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is both <hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45369:36"/>in Praying and Preaching) may be begun and ended in him; to the praiſe and glory of God our Heavenly Father; to their own Souls Health, and the Salvation of thoſe that hear them. Even ſo,</hi> Amen. Allelujah.</p>
            <p>As I have conſulted ſeveral Doctors and Preachers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo in like manner have I read and conſidered the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> and the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I moſt humbly crave leave to make examination, by the Scriptures of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> thereby intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what I find to proceed from God's Holy Spirit of Truth, which are the Things of God, to treaſure them up in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Storehouſes; the reſt that came in with the long dark Night of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> from Man unregenerate in the Fall, meerly Humane, being the Preſcriptions, Traditions, and Impoſitions of Men, not proceeding from the Inſpiration of the Spirit of Truth, I intend to turn back, as your own Mony in your own Sacks.</p>

            <p>Yet, as I am a Prieſt of God, by having Chriſt Jeſus in me, my Prieſt, my Prophet, my King, I have ſomewhat to ſay and declare to the Heads and Governors of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> That none amongſt them preſume to call or own themſelves <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt and his Goſpel:</hi> for not every one that crieth <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> is a true Servant or Miniſter of Chriſt, or fit to Teach, Preach, or Pray in his Name, unleſs they firſt be called of God, and baptized into the ſame Name, and (aſſiſted by his Holy Spirit) as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, elſe none are fit Miniſters of Chriſt; read <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.13, 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.1, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. And that the Spirit of Chriſt be their Induction and Commiſſion, what to Preach, and what to Pray. Let ſuch as are not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and born anew, take heed how they meddle with the Things of God, that they touch not Holy Things with unclean and unſanctified Hearts, and with polluted Hands and Lips, leſt they be ſmitten of God, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> was; and leſt a ſorer Judgment attend them under the Goſpel, who run, and are not ſent, than did thoſe under the Law.</p>
            <p>Thus declaring, I have peace with God, and am clear from the Blood of all Men, that periſh under ſuch Teachers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as have not the Spirit of Chriſt to teach them, and have no other Commiſſion, than from Man; ſuch cauſe the People to err, and go aſtray, and never can profit the Souls of their

            <p>I have obſerved, in reading of our laſt <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> that many material Things might be amended; and that it is better rendred out of the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> than we have it in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For which, ſee ſome places in my Epiſtle to the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he might be the firſt born [in] many Brethren.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh, The first born [amongst] many Brethren.</hi> Which ſeems to deny Chriſt to be in the Saints.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hath</hi> put in <hi>us the Word of Reconciliation.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh, Hath</hi> committed to <hi>us the Word of Reconciliation.</hi> This, I conceive, is for the ſetting up of Man to be the Preacher, and not Chriſt the Word in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Rom. 1.19. <hi>Engliſh, Latin,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> well tranſlate, all ſpeaking one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz. That which is to be known of God is manifeſt, or made known in Man, even his eternal Power and Godhead in the Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. the <hi>Latin</hi> and old <hi>Engliſh Bible</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſpired of God, or, given by inſpiration, is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration,</hi> &amp;c. The which ſeems not to be a Truth, (without a Comment) for there is much written, that is not inſpired of God, even in the Bible it ſelf. In the laſt Edition are ſaid to be amended (from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) many thouſand words. And how many <hi>Copies</hi> (or rather <hi>Autographs</hi>) of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are now in the Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and all differing one from the other. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in his time, the Original Copies (let the Learned pardon the Expreſſion) of the</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi> Greek, <hi>were much corrupted by</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:45369:38"/>Jews <hi>and</hi> Hereticks; <hi>therefore he choſe the</hi> Vulgar Latin (<hi>after he had purged it from Faults, committed by Writers,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>laying aſide all other</hi> Latin <hi>Editions,</hi> which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>were in his time almoſt innumerable.</hi> Thus by reaſon of ſo many falſe Copies, falſe Writers, falſe Tranſlators, and falſe Interpreters, ariſe ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sects and Opinions in Chriſtendom; every Maſter of a Sect taking his Rule from Scripture, and his own private interpretation thereupon. So that if you make the Letter of the Scripture the only Rule, it muſt needs be crooked and uncertain: But God be praiſed, and ever magnified, that hath not left Man without a Witneſs of himſelf in every one, a Rule moſt true and certain, Chriſt the Word in the Heart, which ſhines in the dark Heart of every Man, and is a ſure Word of Prophecy, even Truth in the Inward Parts, to which we do well to take heed, as to a Light that ſhines in a dark place, till the Shadows flee away, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in our Hearts; then ſhall we ſee that it is not any Scripture without us, but the inſpiration of the Almighty (only) that giveth to Man an underſtanding in the things of God, what is Truth, and what is Error; as it is written, <hi>Job</hi> 32.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 54.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.27. So that if you have Chriſt the Word in you, you need no other Teacher, but as that Anointed one teacheth, who is the Truth in every one, both Male and Female, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> they are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, the Truth. Such as have not Chriſt Jeſus, God's true and faithful Witneſs in them, are Reprobates, and can never divide the Word of Truth aright, nor know Truth from Error; neither have they a Will or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to follow the one, or eſchew the other; for Man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not having Chriſt in him, can neither think, nor do any thing to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. The old Tranſlation ſaith, <hi>We do not ſell the Word for Mony.</hi> The laſt Tranſlation ſaith, <hi>We are not as many which corrupt the Word of God.</hi> But ſuch as ſell for Mony, making Merchandize of the Word and Prayer, corrupt the Word and Prayer, and are <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Miniſters, and none of Chriſt's
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45369:38"/>Miniſters; For as they receive freely, ſo they give freely. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one place of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> you ſay, <hi>There is no health in us:</hi> In another you pray quite contrary, <hi>That God will not take his Holy Spirit from us;</hi> alſo, <hi>that God would cleanſe the Thoughts of our Hearts by the Inſpiration of his Holy Spirit.</hi> And you acknowledg, That <hi>all the ends of the Earth have ſeen the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God:</hi> Alſo, that <hi>God hath openly ſhewed his Righteouſneſs in the ſight of all the Heathen.</hi> And is not this what the Scriptures ſay, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. That <hi>Chriſt, the true Light, enlightneth every one that cometh into the World?</hi> And, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. that a <hi>manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit is given</hi> (as a Talent) <hi>to every one to profit with;</hi> that thereby every one may work out his own Salvation if he will. And, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. that <hi>the grace of God that bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath appeared to and in all Men;</hi> that none may truly ſay, <hi>there is no health in us;</hi> for there is that Spirit of Grace in every one, which is the ſaving Health of all that obey it, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all that diſobey, deſpiſe, reject, and hate it; read <hi>John</hi> 3.19, &amp;c.

               <hi>Our Father.]</hi> I obſerve you oft repeat <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Which Prayer is good for a Diſciple of Chriſt to pray, one that is born of the Spirit, ſuch have right to call God their Father, and ſuch God owns for his Children; but thoſe that are unregenerate, who ſerve the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, whoſe Works they will do, for ſuch to call the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, Father, is not this Blaſphemy, and a breach of the firſt Commandment, to <hi>take the Name of God in vain?</hi> And for any to teach this Prayer to unſanctified and unholy Men, Is not this an Abomination that maketh deſolate? As I am a Prieſt to God, I do declare, That all Services, Sacrifices, Prayers, and Acts of Religion, offered up to God in any kind of Devotion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in an unclean, unſanctified, unregenerate Heart, are an abomination to him: but if any Man be a worſhipper of God,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45369:39"/>according to his Will (writ in our Hearts) him he heareth; read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. with <hi>John</hi> 9.31. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. Seeing God doth not hear Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but only heareth his Son, his Spirit, the Word in the Heart, go to him, and in his Son's Name, ask of the Father what ye want, who heareth him, and giveth liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth no Man; ask of him to create in you a clean Heart, and a right Spirit to be put within you, who giveth his Holy Spirit to them that in ſincerity ask it; then ſhall ye have a Heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's own Heart, which will do all his Will here <hi>on Earth, as it is done in Heaven.</hi> This right Spirit, God's Son within us, worketh Miracles in the Saints as in the Son; it raiſeth our Souls out of the Grave of Treſpaſſes and Sins, to live in his Preſence, in Peace, Joy, and Tranquillity, all the days of our Lives. <hi>Amen.

            <p>Athanaſius <hi>his Creed.] Athanaſius</hi> his <hi>Creed</hi> is alſo of great Authority in our Church, which impoſeth a neceſſity of believing the ſame, on no leſs tearms than our Eternal Salvation; yet I judg that there are, amongſt many uſeful Truths, ſome things aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that <hi>Creed,</hi> which are neither needful to Salvation, nor can be made good by the Scriptures of Truth, nor yet by Reaſon Humane or Divine. Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>There is one Perſon of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghoſt; and that the belief hereof,</hi> as he expreſſeth it, <hi>is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> 'Tis true, the Eternal God, who filleth Heaven and Earth with his Preſence, as he is pleaſed to hold forth himſelf in the various manifeſtations of his abſolute Greatneſs, Wiſdom, and Love to the World; ſo he is thereby known to us under ſeveral Names, and Appellations, as moſt proper to thoſe manifeſtations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for what is the Father, but God the Eternal Creator of all things, who forms the Light, and creates the Darkneſs, and of nothing hath made all things to appear in their order, out of the firſt Chaos and Darkneſs of Confuſion? And what is the Son, but the ſame Eternal God, manifeſt in Fleſh; the Word in the beginning with God, and was, and is God, <hi>the Way, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45369:39"/>Truth, the Life, the Covenant of God's Salvation to the World?</hi> This Son (as I conceive) is no diſtinguiſhed Perſon from the Father, but is in Deed, and in Truth, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace; the Word by which the Worlds were made, humbling himſelf into humane Nature, to ſeek out loſt Man, and to gather him into a nearer acquaintance with his God: And what is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but the ſame Eternal Spirit Witneſſing, Quickning, Renewing, Sanctifying, Purifying, Cleanſing, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Hearts of the Faithful, where God is pleaſed to pitch his Tent and Tabernacle? Theſe are the Three that bear witneſs in Heaven; and theſe Three are one, not divided by perſonal diſtinction, but one Individual and Eternal God, in variety of manifeſtation. Then, he ſaith, <hi>In this Trinity, none is afore nor after another, and none is greater nor leſs than another: Yet,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction he ſaith, <hi>the Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but begotten.</hi> Certainly he that begets, muſt be before, and greater than he that is begotten. For my part I am more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than to believe all Men damned that never heard of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> his <hi>Creed;</hi> and am well ſatisfied, that <hi>whoſoever believes in Chriſt (that was, that is, and is to come, God's Everlaſting Covenant of Light and Grace, to Jew and Gentile; and his Salvation to the ends of the Earth) ſhall be ſaved, even all of every Nation that feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs.</hi> Allelujah.</p>

               <hi>Infant Baptiſm.]</hi> Concerning <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> with Water, I may not ſay it is an Ordinance of Chriſt, nor dare I call it <hi>Chriſt's Baptiſm;</hi> neither do I think there is that virtue in it as is ſaid, That <hi>it ingrafts into Chriſt's Church, makes a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And whether thoſe God-Fathers, and God-Mothers, that undertake, promiſe, and vow, on behalf of the Child, That when of Age, he <hi>ſhall forſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of the World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh; and that he ſhall keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of his life.</hi> I ſay, it would be inquired into, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe God-Fathers, and God-Mothers, do perform and keep
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45369:40"/>this Oath, Promiſe, and Vow, themſelves? If not, then why ſhould they undertake for another, what they perform not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And if I miſtake not, it is a Tenent of the Church of <hi>Englands, That we cannot live free from ſin ſo long as we live in this World.</hi> If ſo, were it not far better never to Swear and Vow, than afterwards to break them? Is not this to add Sin unto Sin, and ſo bring a greater condemnation on our ſelves? As I am a Prieſt to God, by having Chriſt Jeſus in me, I declare, That <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm</hi> is no Ordinance of Chriſt's, neither is <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with Water, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm; Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is to be baptized <hi>into the Name, Nature, and Spirit of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which Baptiſm of the Spirit, is the <hi>one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptiſm; one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in us all, that are born of, and baptized with the Spirit of Grace.</hi> This Baptiſm, is that alone which ſaveth, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, and <hi>not by putting away the filth of the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God.</hi> And this Baptiſm of the Spirit (which followed <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Repentance) is that only which can initiate into the Church of God, make a Child of God, and give an entrance into, and an inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I query, Whether <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> were not the Invention of Man, rather than the Command of God, brought in by the falſe Church (for advantage-ſake) in the long dark night of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> after that the True Church was fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there fed, and preſerved of God, whilſt the Whore, the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet ruled; who ſet up Shadows inſtead of Chriſt the Subſtance, the Letter above the Spirit, Man's Baptiſm, which is with Water, inſtead of Chriſt's, by Fire, which is the Holy Ghoſt? And inſtead of putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the New Man, which is the Saints Righteouſneſs, they put on a white Linnen Surplice, to make them ſeem outwardly Holy, that inwardly were full of Sin and Uncleanneſs; full of Self-love, Hypocriſy, and Pride; full of Covetouſneſs, Hatred, Malice,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45369:40"/>and all Uncharitableneſs. And inſtead of bowing at the Name of God, (which is the Command of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.23.) that every knee ſhould bow to him, you bow at the Name of a Man, not greater than is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> which is the Name God himſelf gave the Virgin's Birth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. who is the only begotten Son of God in all the Sanctified, that ſaves his People from their Sins. And your bowing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> rather than at the Name <hi>Immanuel,</hi> doth it not demonſtrate you to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Angels, rather than the true God? And for you to bow down to any Letters, or Syllables, joined into a Name of God, or Man, is this, think you, to worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, as he requireth? And for any to bow down and worſhip any Thing or Name, that is not purely God alone, is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Idolatry and falſe Worſhip. And be not ignorant, that <hi>the Name of God is</hi> (his Power, his Love ſhed abroad in our Hearts, his <hi>Immanuel</hi>) <hi>a ſtrong Tower, whereinto the Righteous flee, and are there in Peace, Reſt, and Safety.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holy Days.] Holy Days,</hi> both <hi>Faſting Days,</hi> and <hi>Feaſting Days,</hi> were they brought in by the Command of God, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and impoſed by Man? Was not St. <hi>Paul</hi> afraid of his <hi>Galatians,</hi> that he had beſtowed his labour on them in vain? who inſtead of ſetting up, and forming of Chriſt the Day-Star in their Hearts, fell to the obſervation of <hi>Days,</hi> and <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Years;</hi> ſetting up of <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks;</hi> what to Eat, and when to eat; and what and when to forbear, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>New Moons,</hi> and <hi>Sabbath Days,</hi> one day more holy than another; all which, in the firſt Covenant, were but ſhadows of good Things to come, which the Saints poſſeſs and enjoy in the ſecond Covenant, which is <hi>Chriſt in them,</hi> the end of the firſt Covenant, <hi>their Hope, their Crown, and Glory.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Commandment, you pray, That <hi>God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your hearts to keep this Law;</hi> which is, <hi>to keep holy the Seventh day,</hi> (according to God's Command to the <hi>Jews):</hi> Thus by your Traditions, ye make void the Law of God, and change the Truth of God into a Lie; and by bringing in the Old Covenant,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45369:41"/>which ſtands in divers outward Obſervations, which maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect, ye have thruſt out the New Covenant, Chriſt, the Word in the Heart, the Saints Teacher, which perfecteth for ever thoſe that are ſanctified. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>

               <hi>The Lord's Supper.]</hi> The <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> I humbly declare to be a great Myſtery, not rightly underſtood by Man in the Fall: It is not Carnal Bread and Wine, neither Carnal Fleſh and Blood, as unregenerate Men apprehend and imagine. Chriſt's Words and Works are more Spiritual, than for Carnal Men to underſtand them; it is <hi>the Spirit that quickneth, and the Inſpiration of God alone that giveth to man underſtanding in the things of God.</hi> The true Supper of our Lord is, when Chriſt ſtands at the door of our Hearts and knocks, that we then open to him, and he comes in to us, and ſups with us. This is the right Supper of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Firſt and the Laſt, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all our Graces and Mercies. Wherefore, my dear Hearts, <hi>Open O ye Gates, and be lift up ye everlaſting Doors, that Chriſt the King of Glory may come in, and ſup with you.</hi> Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah.</p>
            <p>So the Fleſh and Blood, Bread and Wine that comes from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is Chriſt's Spirit of Light, his Body, which he gives for the Life of the World; this is Meat indeed, and Drink indeed, that feeds and nouriſheth the Soul up to Eternal Life; which Cup of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> is the ſaving Health of all Nations that dwell upon the Face of the whole Earth. <hi>O my dearly Beloved, take and receive, eat and drink abundantly of this Cup of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is the new Wine in our Father's Kingdom, a Fountain of Life that can never be drawn dry.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>Behold, I ſhew to you a Myſtery; the Word in the Heart, the Love of God ſhed abroad in our Hearts, is the Leaves of the Tree of Life, St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> given for the healing of the Nations, for the uniting of all Sects and Opinions in Religion, into the one true Religion, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all Sorts or Names whatſoever, whether called <hi>Roman Catholicks, Epiſcopal

               <hi>Tithes.]</hi> Alſo I query, Whether <hi>Tithes</hi> ſet out in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Church, were done by a Command or Law of God, or by a Law of Man? And if you receive them as from a Command of God to the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood,</hi> then are you to maintain all the Poor, the Fatherleſs, and Widows, out of them, that there may not be a Beggar in <hi>England,</hi> as there was not in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And if you receive them, as from a Law of Man, then, Whether a forced Maintenance by Man's Law, be a ſuitable and proper Maintenance for the Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus? who receive free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him the Things of God, and ſo they give and diſpenſe freely thoſe Things, without Mony, and without Price, not for filthy Lucre-ſake, but of a ready Mind, and only to them they ſow Spiritual Things, of them they reap Carnal; and not by a Law of Compulſion, but by the Law of Love only, which is Chriſt's Law and Command to his Diſciples and Followers. <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah.</hi>

And as all Chriſt's Miniſters are, and ever were, Commiſſionated, Aſſiſted, and Inſtructed by his Holy Spirit, when and what they ſhall Preach, and when and what they ſhall Pray: but 'tis not ſo with Miniſters made by a Carnal Commandment of Man, that receive their Commiſſion from Man only. Such <hi>run</hi> (with <hi>Balaam</hi>) <hi>after Gifts and Rewards, who preach for Hire, and ſeek for Gain from their quarters;</hi> ſuch, I declare, are no true Miniſters of Chriſt, neither can ever any ſuch (as have not Chriſt in them) profit the Souls of People at all; for all God's People are taught of him, and great is their Peace. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> Doth not <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>O God, thou hast taught me from my Youth up?</hi> And the Meek God doth teach. And <hi>Job</hi> (who was no <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> but an <hi>Edomite</hi>) ſaith, He <hi>did teach from the Hand of the Lord, and that he was taught by immediate Revelation and Inſpiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in God's Mountain,</hi> (which is his Spirit) <hi>he teacheth of his ways, and that all God's Children are taught of him;</hi> and that God had anointed him to Preach, (which Unction is Truth in the Inward Parts, and no Lie) and teacheth the Way of God truly; which teaching of God's Spirit, is the way to God, wherein no Man can err, though a Fool. And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>In thoſe days (of the Spirits teaching) I will make a New Covenant, ſaith the Lord; for I will write my Law in their Hearts, and put my Spirit in their inward parts; and they ſhall teach no more every Man their Neighbour, for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Allelujah. And <hi>Jonah</hi> preached what he received from the Mouth of the Lord, and what the Lord taught him. And <hi>Micah,</hi> (a true Prophet of the Lord) ſaith, <hi>That</hi> (in the time of the Spirit's Reign and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) <hi>the Mountain of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed on the top of the Mountains, and many People ſhall flow to it; and ſhall ſay of God, He will there teach us of his Ways, and we will walk in his Paths; for the Law ſhall go out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem: which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Zion,</hi> is no earthly Building made of Wood and Stone, but the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45369:42"/>the ſanctified Heart, the new Heart, and right Spirit, a City whoſe Maker and Builder is God, Father and Mother, Siſter and Brother of all God's Children. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> And did not <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> (whoſe Baptiſm was from Heaven) teach his Diſciples how and what to Preach, and how and what to Pray, ſaying, <hi>As ye go, preach, the Kingdom of God is at hand?</hi> And God the Father taught Holy Jeſus his Son, to preach deliverance to the Captives, (all thoſe that truly repent) the acceptable Year of the Lord. And as his Father taught him, ſo taught he his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſaying, <hi>Go ye into the High-ways and Hedges, and tell the Blind, the Lame, and the Halt, even all that are ſmall, and little in their own eyes, all that are heavy laden with Sin, let ſuch come and buy Eye-ſalve, buy the ſincere Milk of the Word, without Mony, and without Price.</hi> And did not Holy Jeſus preach often in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Synagogues of the <hi>Jews?</hi> and did he not weep over them, who were ſo hard-hearted towards him, that when he would have gathered them together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, yet they would not be healed nor covered under the Wings of the Cherubims, that attend the Mercy Seat of God, from under whoſe Wings of Grace and Love, ariſeth healing to all that are weary of their Sins? And Holy Jeſus alſo ſaith, <hi>As my Father taught me, I ſpeak and do;</hi> and as his Father taught him, ſo taught he his Diſciples, the New and Everlaſting Covenant, How that (by his Light and Spirit) all God's People ſhould be taught of the Lord, and that great ſhould be their Peace: and that thoſe who would be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, muſt learn of him, to be low, and meek in Heart, and to take up the daily Croſs to their own Wills; which made him to deny his own Will, to do the Will of the Father; as you may read <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>John</hi> 4.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.38. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45369:43"/>have nothing elſe to teach them, ſave the dead Letter, and their own Interpretations thereupon. Thus when Jeſus had breathed on his Diſciples, and given them the Holy Ghoſt, he ſaith, <hi>Go ye, and teach all Nations, baptiſing them into the Name, Nature, and Power of Chriſt's Spirit;</hi> not with material Water, for that is <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but with Fire, which is the Holy Ghoſt, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one true Baptiſm, which waſheth and cleanſeth the Soul, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates and begets the New Man Chriſt in us; all ſuch who have their Hearts and Conſciences waſhed and ſprinkled from evil Works, to ſerve the Living God, are with faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> happy and bleſſed. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Diſciples had received the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, yet they were to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there wait in that Spirit, till they were indued with a fuller meaſure of the ſame Spirit from on High, then they went forth converting many thouſand Souls, turning them from Darkneſs to Light, from the power of Satan to the Power of God, his Spirit in themſelves; and as they had received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit freely, ſo they gave the Spirit; read <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.37, 38, 39, 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.3, 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10, 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. In the Power of which Spirit, the Diſciples did not only do the Works and Miracles Jeſus did, but greater, when (as Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi> ſaith) Chriſt was riſen in them. <q>Thus by the fooliſhneſs of the Spirit's Preaching, it pleaſed God to ſave thoſe that believe and obey the Word in the Heart, (as Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith); which Word Incarnate, is God's Preacher to all the World, and God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</q>

Thus to the Pure, all things are pure, to all ſuch as ſing in the movings and joy of God's Spirit, with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, making melody in their hearts to the Lord. So let Chriſt, the Word, dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another, in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs, ſinging with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord; <hi>Bleſſed are the People that are in ſuch a caſe, who have Chriſt the Lord for their God, working all their Works in them and for them, both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
            <p>I do believe the <hi>Church of England,</hi> the beſt conſtituted Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church in the World; and adorned with many of her Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, the beſt Learned, and moſt ſound in Doctrine; and for integrity of Life, and Converſation, moſt Sweet, moſt Humble, Meek, and Charitable; whoſe Plat-forms of Religion (of all the National Profeſſions) I judg the moſt large, and likely to gather together, and build up into Love and good Works, which is the Sum of all true Chriſtian Religion, and the End both of the Law and Goſpel. Yet as I know there may be many things amended, ſome left out, and ſome added, in the <hi>Nine and thirty Articles,</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayer Book;</hi> ſo I well know, there is that Wiſdom and Underſtanding in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (if called
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45369:45"/>together, to weigh and conſider of theſe Matters) as will not only correct and amend what is amiſs, but alſo add thoſe things that may much illuſtrate Truth, to the Edification and Salvation of Souls, and to the building up, and uniting ſeveral different perſwaſions in the Truth, and in Love towards each other, who now at preſent are much divided. I do alſo know, that there are, and ever were, Operations and Adminiſtrations of God in the World, all wrought by one and the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p>The firſt Diſpenſation is, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> under which Adminiſtration, Men were taught to ſerve and worſhip God, by the ſeven Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> taught from Father to Son; and ſuch as were ſincere and upright hearted in that Worſhip, pleaſed God, and were accepted of him; who requires no more of any, than what they have, and not what they have not.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Adminiſtration was from <hi>Moſes,</hi> through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, unto <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> and ſuch are taught by wiſe Rules taken out of the Law and Prophets, and need a learned Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miniſtry, ſuch as are well read in Natural Philoſophy, and in Divinity, to expound and preach to the People thoſe things that tend to Peace and Godlineſs, to love God (the Light and Life of our Souls) above all things Terreſtrial, and our Neighbour (which is all mankind) as our ſelves: In theſe two conſiſt the Sum and Subſtance of all true Religion; but by no means to preach thoſe things that are Doubtful or Controverſal, all that tends to the dividing of Chriſt's ſeamleſs Coat, and not to unite in the Truth, but to deſtroy it. Truth in the inward Parts, is that which all Men of all Religions agree to, without Diſpute; <q>Which Diſpute ever was and is (as ſaith Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>) the Scab of the Church, and Bane of all true Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The third and laſt Adminiſtration is from <hi>John</hi> (the greateſt of all Prophets, born of a Woman, or that ſtick in Form or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45369:46"/>ward Obſervations) unto Chriſt, the Word in the Heart, who is without form or comlineſs, the eternal and only begotten Son of God before <hi>Abraham;</hi> he was, and is, and is to come, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Carnal Father, or Carnal Mother; without beginning of Days, or end of Life, God's <hi>High Prieſt for ever, after the Order Melchiſedeck,</hi> which is the Order of the Holy Ghoſt; and all ſuch, born of God's Spirit of Grace, having Chriſt Jeſus in them, are the only Sons and Daughters of God; and need no other Teacher, ſave God alone. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I likewiſe know there are dividings of Names and Opinions in the <hi>Church of England;</hi> ſome receive the Doctrines and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> others rather chuſe <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> for their Guides: Thus is Chriſt divided, when in Truth Chriſt is but one Eternal Univerſal Spirit of Love, Light, and Life, in all Men, of all Religions in the World, and God's Salvation through Him is to the ends of the Earth.</p>
            <p>For the ſake of thoſe that thus diſagree, I have looked into, and conſidered the Grounds and Cauſes of their Diviſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine, I find chiefly to conſiſt; firſt, Againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and that they were unlawful; againſt Free-will; againſt the Pope's Supremacy, and his Excommunication; againſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Poſſeſſions of the Clergy; againſt Merit of Works, and Monaſtick Life; againſt Canonical Obedience, and diſtinction of Meats; againſt Tranſubſtantiation, and Communion under one kind; againſt the Maſs, and Aurigular Confeſſion; againſt Abſolution, and Purgatory; againſt extream Unction, and five of the Sacraments. He alſo held, That <hi>General Councils</hi> might err; that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was not a particular Perſon, but a Spirit, contrary and againſt Chriſt's Spirit; that Faith only juſtifieth, yet Man is not ſaved without good Works; that a faithful Man might have aſſurance of his Salvation; that the Sacrament did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Grace, but was a ſign of it; that to the Faithful Sin is not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45369:46"/>imputed. And ſome of his Followers ſay, <q>That we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith or Works, but by the eſſential Righteouſneſs of Chriſt dwelling in us.</q> And by <hi>Luther</hi>'s proteſting againſt the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in theſe Things, firſt began the Name <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine I find to conſiſt herein; Firſt, he ſaith, <q>The Scriptures are a ſufficient Rule to Life, &amp; the only Judg of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; that the Elect only have ſaving Faith; that Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination to Life and Death, depends not in Man's Obedience or Diſobedience, but on God's Choice; that the true Church of God, conſiſteth only of the Elect; that the Church and Magiſtrate may not make Laws to bind the Conſcience in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Religious and Divine; that Sins are inherent in us, though not imputed to us; that Faith is a more excellent Vertue than Charity; that there is no merit in us; that there is but two Sacraments, and theſe can neither juſtify nor confer Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Doctrines, I find chiefly to conſiſt in this; Firſt, That there is no Origninal Sin in us, derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> that there is a free-will to Goodneſs in us; that we may here fulfil the Law of God, if we walk in the Grace given us to profit with, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.) that the Cauſes of Predeſtination are not in God, but in our ſelves, who obey or diſobey the Grace of God, given as a Talent to every one to work out his own Salvation; that Chriſt did not ſatisfy for us, but gives power by his Grace to ſatisfy for our Selves; that there is not a Trinity of Perſons in one God; he denies that God hath elected a certain number to Salvation, and reprobated the reſidue to eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; he denies that God's Juſtice was ſatisfied by Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and that God needed no ſuch rigid Satisfaction; that Men are not made really Righteous, by any imputation from another's Righteouſneſs without, whilſt they are really unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous within; he doth not believe that Chriſt aſcended into
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45369:47"/>Heaven with his humane Body of Fleſh, Blood, and Bones; but that Body which he hath is more Spiritual and Glorious; he owns the Spirit of Grace in every Man ſufficient (to all that obey and follow it) to lead into Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arminius</hi> his Doctrines, I find chiefly to be theſe; Firſt, That God hath not elected ſome, and reprobated others; that God is juſt in ſaving thoſe that believe and obey his Goſpel, and in condemning thoſe only that reject and diſobey it: Which I take to be according to Truth; read <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14, 15, 19. That Men are not made juſt by Imputative Righteouſneſs only, but Inherent; that Man is not made Righteous within, by any imputation from another's Righteouſneſs from without, whilſt he is really unrighteous within: which I take to be ſound Doctrine; read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11, 13, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.6. He affirms, That the Grace of God is ſufficient to lead Men, that obey and follow it, into Eternal Life. This I take alſo to be ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, agreeable to Truth; read <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. He ſays, Chriſt's Carnal Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, is not aſcended into Heaven; read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.63. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. That God hath not decreed to leave any Man in the ſtate of Damnation. This alſo agrees with the Scriptures; read <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. That God affordeth ſufficient means to bring to the knowledg of Chriſt, by his Light and Spirit of Grace within every one; read <hi>John</hi> 1.4, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. That Chriſt did not die for the Elect only, but taſted death for every Man, even his Enemies, by giving his Light and Life unto every one, as <hi>John</hi> 1.4, 9. Which Spirit of Grace, if any reſiſt or deſpiſe, ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify to themſelves the Lord of Life afreſh. That Original Sin of it ſelf is not ſufficient to condemn Mankind to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This alſo is a Truth; read <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.2, 3, 4. That an unregenerate Man is not totally and finally dead to Sin,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45369:47"/>and deſtitute of ſpiritual Strength, but that he may (by God's Grace) hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, and live; this alſo agrees with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.14. That Grace and Free-Will are cooperating Cauſes in our Converſion, and that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is not the effect of Election, but is attained by virtue of the New Covenant; read <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.5.

That there is free Will to Goodneſs in us, by God's free Grace; read <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. That God could juſtly pardon our Sins, (when by his Grace we repent) without any other ſatisfaction, than his own free Mercy and Grace. That God doth not predeſtinate any to Damnation, but as they obey or diſobey his Laws; read <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.4. <hi>Job</hi> 36.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 22.</p>
            <p>I humbly beg pardon that I have preſumed to illuſtrate the Sentiments of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines, with Scriptures; it is, becauſe they have bin much cried out againſt as <hi>errant Hereticks,</hi> although upon examination, I find them more ſound in the True Faith, than thoſe that call them ſo: And by that ſmall experience I have obtained, both by reading and otherwiſe, I find and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that thoſe that are indeed the greateſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> cry <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> firſt.

And I have known one of late Years much cried out againſt as a <hi>notorious Heretick and Blaſphemer,</hi> for preaching up Chriſt in the Saints, God's New Covenant, and the Way to Life Eternal. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>

'Tis You that the great expectation of many of the Lord's People in this Nation is now towards: Our Wounds &amp; Breaches in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of Religion are too wide and extenſive for a formal, outward, and literal Miniſtry to heal and cement. We have languiſhed in Diviſions too long already, under theſe Phyſicians; 'tis only a Spirit-Miniſtry, with evidence, demonſtration, and power (that proceeds from an innate Principle of the Love of God ſhed abroad in our Hearts) that can compoſe all our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, ſatisfy all Parties and Intereſts, and ſettle us upon a ſure Foundation of Peace, Reſt, and Happineſs.

            </p>
            <p>I know (by what I have read in your Books) that you <hi>Three</hi> all agree (as do many other of the <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>) in the Birth of Chriſt, as he was the Son of Man, born of a Virgin; that he lived a Holy Life, <hi>was crucified, dead, and buried; that he aroſe the third day, and aſcended into Heaven,</hi> with his Natural Body of <hi>Fleſh, Blood,</hi> and <hi>Bones.</hi> And that your believing of what Chriſt did and ſuffered here on Earth in his own Perſon, is your <hi>Salvation;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> of yours I humbly crave leave to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> And as I am a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to the World, by having Chriſt Jeſus in me, I ſay, and declare, That unleſs ye <hi>be born of the Spirit,</hi> and have the ſame Spirit in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus, to lead into Truth and Righteouſneſs, as it did him, ye are no true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor ever can ſee the Kingdom of God; read <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. And except the Spirit of God's Grace kill Sin in us, as in him, Chriſt's Death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will do us but little good; read <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.6, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13.

            <p>I alſo know and declare, That in the true <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures united in one Perſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As he was the Son of God from all Eternity, and is the Birth of God in all the Sanctified, He is <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45369:51"/>Secondly, As he was the Son of Man, born of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of a Reaſonable Soul, ſubſiſting as ſuch, he <hi>could do nothing of himſelf,</hi> and denied himſelf, and his own Will, and was compaſſed about with many Infirmities, like unto other Men, Sin only excepted; read <hi>John</hi> 5.30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>As he was the Son of Man, he was but a Creature, having beginning of Days and end of Life. But as he was the Son of God, he was <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> without <hi>beginning of Days, and end of Life,</hi> God's Everlaſting Covenant of Light and Life to the World.</p>
            <p>As he was the Son of Man, filled with the Holy Ghoſt, he had <hi>a Body prepared to do the Will of God</hi> here <hi>on Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> (as all that are born of God have); not only as our Example, but for our Conſolation, and Salvation; and thus it is with all that are born of the Spirit; read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>John</hi> 13.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>James</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. So you ſee it is the Birth of the Spirit (in all the Sanctified) and not the Humane Nature, that is the Saviour: Not what Jeſus did (as he was the Son of Man) at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his own Perſon only, but what he did, and for ever doth, in the Saints, as he was, is, and for ever ſhall be, one and the ſame, God's only begotten Son, the Word in the Heart, his Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant of Light and Life to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> and ſo he is <hi>God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> Allelujah. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I would you might underſtand, That all born of the Spirit, are born of God, and have the mind and Spirit in them that was in Chriſt Jeſus; and do the ſame Works, and greater Works; <hi>When</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith) <hi>Christ is riſen in them:</hi> for, are they not the <hi>Light of the World, and Salt of the Earth?</hi> walk as Chriſt walked, and are in this World, as he is in Heaven? read <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>John</hi> 14.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:45369:52"/>As Chriſt by the Spirit of the Father was filled with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, in which Spirit the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead doth dwell bodily,</hi> of whoſe fulneſs is given to all the Sanctified, <hi>Grace for Grace;</hi> And as they receive the Spirit of Grace freely, ſo they diſpenſe the Word and Spirit of Grace freely: for did not <hi>Paul</hi> give the Spirit? read <hi>Acts</hi> 19.3, to 7. And was not that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>Timothy</hi> received, by the laying on of his hands, called, <hi>The Gift of God?</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. And did not he that miniſtred the Spirit to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> give the Spirit to them? read <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5. And did not <hi>Paul,</hi> by virtue and power of the Spirit's Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, <hi>convert Thouſands,</hi> turning them <hi>from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God?</hi> And was it not by the virtue of the ſame Power of the Spirit, that <hi>Peter</hi> converted, at one Sermon, about <hi>Five thouſand?</hi> And was it not the Power of the ſame Spirit in Chriſt Jeſus, in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Followers, and in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and in all the <hi>Prophets</hi> and Men of God, that wrought and did all the Wonders and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ever ſince the World began?</p>
            <p>And this I do further declare to all the World, as my Opinion, That whoſoever is not born of this Spirit, and led by this Spirit of God, is no true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> nor Miniſter of Chriſt; nor ever can profit the People, or convert Souls to God. I know that a Man void of the Spirit, may, through the Light of Reaſon, in the Letter, beget and bring Men into a <hi>Sect,</hi> and into an <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> ſo ſtrong, that he may come to die for it, (as we ſee in the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp;c.) yet for the ſake of Chriſt, and his Leadings, will not forſake their Luſts, nor their own Self-Wills; <hi>This is</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith) <hi>falſe Martyrdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo I know you <hi>Three</hi> are all <hi>One</hi> in many other Opinions; You agree with <hi>Calvin,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Scriptures are the Word of God, and a ſufficient Rule of Life to meaſure and try Doctrines and Spirits by, under the Goſpel, and the only Judg of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:45369:52"/>And, as is printed before the <hi>Bible,</hi> with Marginal Notes, <hi>Here is the Spring where Waters flow, to quench the heat of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Here is the Bread that feeds the Life, that Death cannot aſſail,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Fortreſs of our Faith is here, and Shield of our Defence,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas in truth the Scriptures (without the Spirit) are but a dead Letter put in the place of Chriſt, who is the only <hi>true Bread and Water of Life.</hi> But inſtead of Chriſt in us, the New Creature, the Word in the Heart, and only Rule of Life, that ends all Controverſies, and leads into Love and Union, even all that walk therein, you place the Dead Letter, which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but never endeth Strife and Controverſies amongſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> And indeed how can it be, that the Scriptures ſhould ever end Controverſies, ſeeing there are ſo many falſe Copies, and every one differing from each other, that no Man knows the True? nor do I think there is any without Error, nor any ſo falſe, but that there is much Truth in it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <q>That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, were much perverted by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> ſo that he rather choſe the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> (though many Faults were committed by Writers in that alſo); which having amended, he laid aſide all other <hi>Latin Verſions,</hi> which, he ſaith (in his Time) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable.</q> So that I ſee, in thoſe <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> there were no True Copies to be found; and that if you make the Written Scriptures your full Rule, it will be but a crooked one, ſuch as every Man, by his private Interpretation, makes as a Noſe of Wax to turn every way; and putting that Authority upon the Scriptures, by making them the Rule of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Life, and End of Controverſies, is ſo far from working this End, that it hath broched more <hi>Hereſies</hi> and falſe <hi>Opinions,</hi> than ever were known in the World before theſe laſt and perilous Times. And there can be no recovery out of this Gulph of Miſery, but as Men come to forſake this great Idol the Letter, and putting no more ſtreſs and confidence in it, than in a Declaration of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45369:53"/>Truth, when firſt written and uncorrupted; and that Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Word of God, the Volumn of God's Book, the Word in the Heart, which never can be corrupted nor changed, the ſure Word of Prophecy, which if a Man obey, will ſurely lead into Life Eternal. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſetting up the Letter above the Spirit, and Man by Carnal Force making himſelf Judg thereof, hath bin the cauſe of all the Innocent Blood ſhed (upon the account of Religion) from <hi>Abel</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Gell,</hi> a pious Man, and well read in the <hi>Oriental Tongues,</hi> hath writ a Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, entituled, <hi>An Eſſay towards an amendment of the laſt Engliſh Tranſlation of the Bible;</hi> wherein many Faults are found, and amended by him. And the Makers of the laſt <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> ſay, in their <hi>Preface,</hi> They <hi>had amended many thouſand Words that were amiſs in the former Tranſlation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore my Advice is, That all accounted <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void vain Jangling and Diſputing about Religion, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which eats as a Canker, and is as a Peſt in the Church, and deſtroys all true Religion, which conſiſts in brotherly Love and Kindneſs; which Love edifies, and is the Sum and Subſtance both of Law and Goſpel. Rather learn to judg and condemn your ſelves, than your Brethren; this is the way to have Peace with God, and Unity and Amity one with another, though of different Opinions and Perſwaſions. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe with <hi>Calvin</hi> ye agree, <q>That Predeſtination to Life and Death, depends not on Man's Obedience, or Diſobedience, but on God's Choice; and that God from all Eternity elected a certain number to Salvation, and reprobated the reſidue to Eternal Damnation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which Opinion I take to be greatly inconſiſtent with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and moſt unprofitable to maintain as Doctrinal amongſt Men; for God would <hi>have all Men ſaved, by coming to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45369:53"/>the Knowledg of the Truth,</hi> and by obeying the ſame. To which end our moſt gracious Lord God hath ſo <hi>loved the World, as to ſend his only begotten Son into the World,</hi> the Word in the Heart, that was in the beginning with God, and is God, his Covenant of Light to the World, and <hi>his Salvation to the ends of the Earth,</hi> to <hi>enlighten every one that cometh into the World,</hi> that all Men (of all Opinions and Religions) might believe in him (that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham</hi> was); and by following and obeying him, who is the Truth in every one, all might come to ſee their Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of Death, and ſo come to enjoy Life Eternal, which Life is in his Son <hi>Immanuel. Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye alſo believe with <hi>Calvin;</hi> 
               <q>That by Chriſt's outward Life and Sufferings in his fleſhly Teſtimony, God's Juſtice was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for Sins; and Juſtification compleatly wrought for the Elect, not only by forgiving ſins paſt, but reputing really juſt, whilſt actually ſinful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I apprehend them more ſound in the Faith, who believe that Chriſt cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be the Cauſe, as the Effect, of the Father's Love; for <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. And although ſuch are forgiven, who truly repent, (and that Remiſſion is ſealed by Chriſt's Blood, the Sacrifice and Blood of Sprinkling on our Conſciences) yet Men are not made Righteous within, by any Imputation from another's Righteouſneſs without, whilſt they are really unrighteous within themſelves.</p>
            <p>Ye alſo deny the Light, the Word in the Heart, to be Chriſt that ſhines in his Spiritual Appearance in his People; which is certainly a great Error, and contrary to Scripture, and the Saints Experience; read <hi>John</hi> 1.4, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.46. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.4. <hi>John</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Ye alſo deny that Chriſt's Light can lead Men that obey it unto Salvation; which alſo is contrary to Scripture, and the Saints Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; read <hi>Job</hi> 29.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 43.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119.105. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:45369:54"/>Ye alſo deny the Spirit to be poured out in theſe Days, as in former Ages; or that Men ought to wait for the Motions of it, to Preach, Pray, or praiſe God; which is alſo contrary to the Scriptures, and the Saints Experience; read <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40.31. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Thus far all Three agree in one, as concerning the main Points of your Faith and Religion; but in ſome things Doctrinal, and concerning Diſcipline, and other outward Obſervations, I know you diſagree.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Rule of Publick Worſhip is, their <hi>Directory,</hi> put together by their <hi>Synod,</hi> which ſat 1644, and 45, gathered out of the Scriptures, and impoſed on the People of <hi>England</hi> by an <hi>Act</hi> then made. Which Worſhip, as it was preſcribed and impoſed by Man, I query, Whether it be the Worſhip which God requires, the which conſiſts in the Spirit of Truth? or is it, think you, more acceptable to God, than the former <hi>Service</hi> you threw out, to ſet up your own deviſed <hi>Service</hi> in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? And in ſo doing, whether you did not more aim at the Fleece, than the ſaving of Souls, I leave to the Witneſs of God to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in your ſelves?</p>
            <p>And I pray give me liberty further to enquire, Whether the Nation in General had any benefit by your change of <hi>Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</hi> And whether <hi>Tithes</hi> were not as acceptably retained by you, as by thoſe you thruſt out? Beſides great <hi>Augmentations</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Preachers by a Law for their Encouragement; and a Law for treble Dammages, from all who (though for Conſcience ſake) could not pay the Tithes; and were you leſs troubleſom to ſuch, than thoſe you ejected? or, were you leſs perſecutive? or, had you more humble, meek, charitable Spirits than they? to which your own actings may ſpeak and anſwer.</p>
            <p>What Spirit was that which acted <hi>Calvin</hi> againſt <hi>Servetus? Hugo Grotius</hi> (a moſt learned Man in all kind of Learning, both
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45369:54"/>Humane and Divine) ſaith, <q>That <hi>Michael Servetus,</hi> by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of <hi>Calvin,</hi> was burnt alive at <hi>Geneva;</hi> and for nothing more, than that he differed in ſome Opinions concerning <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s rigid Predeſtination, and ſomething concerning the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </q> And did not this Spirit of <hi>Calvin</hi> ſo act againſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s Diſciples, that they were twice expelled the <hi>Palatinate?</hi> And how did this bitter Spirit act in the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Dort?</hi> Were not many learned, pious, and good Men condemned, and afterwards baniſhed and expelled the Land? and all this for ſome few Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, (perhaps more true than their own.) And was it not this Spirit in others which ſo bitterly perſecuted thoſe Innocent People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom they Impriſoned, Baniſhed, Scourged, Stigmatized, putting them to greater torture, than if they had killed them outright? And was not this the ſame Spirit in them, who, leaving <hi>Old England</hi> for Conſcience-ſake, went to <hi>New England,</hi> where they perſecuted their Innocent Brethren that differed from them in ſome ſmall Points, baniſhing them into the remoteſt Deſarts, where they were murthered by the <hi>Savage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians?</hi> And did they not deal after the ſame manner with Mr. <hi>Samuel Gorton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> and others, that went under the Name of <hi>Antinomians, Seekers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To manifeſt your Spirit one and the ſame, from firſt to laſt; and to ſhew that you are no true Members of <hi>Chriſt's Church</hi> in this particular, not being covered with his Spirit of Love to Brethren, and to Enemies, the only mark of his Diſciples; did not you lately hang and take away the lives of <hi>five Innocent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?</hi> and Baniſhing, Whipping, and cutting off Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of many others, who had not broken any juſt Law, either of God, or Man; only as the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> made a Law againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Brethren; and as did the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt Holy Jeſus, who ſaid, <hi>They had made a Law, and by that Law he ought to die;</hi> even ſo did you make a Law againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to enſnare them, and to take away their Lives. Which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Perſecution, for Matters of Religion, is moſt certainly the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Whore,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet;</hi> which Spirit
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45369:55"/>hath no agreement in the leaſt meaſure with Chriſt and his Church. And did not you (as you came into Power) all three agree in this Spirit, to perſecute thoſe that differed from you? and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that had Chriſt, the Word in the Heart, and preached Chriſt in the Spirit, to be the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Although in many things you agree, yet in ſome ſmall Matters you are divided, and zealouſly perſecute each other for thoſe things wherein you differ. The difference between the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> and the <hi>Independent,</hi> conſiſts chiefly in their <hi>National Church,</hi> and <hi>particular Gatherings,</hi> which aſſemble together by a Covenant made amongſt themſelves, whereby they are admitted as Members; and their Children only admitted to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> under the Notion, of <hi>the Promiſe being made to Believers and their Seed.</hi> In the Fundamentals of their Faith no material difference.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Independent Gatherings,</hi> by the difference of the <hi>Adminiſtration of Water-Baptiſm;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer only admitting ſuch Subjects to that <hi>Ordinance,</hi> as are able to render a laudable <hi>Confeſſion of their Faith in God,</hi> and alſo of their holy and juſt Converſation amongſt Men; and by this <hi>Baptiſm</hi> they hold, That <hi>ſuch Subjects are initiated into the Church of Chriſt, and are from thence-forth eſteemed Brethren, and not before.</hi> Theſe alſo are different from each other among themſelves; about <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Redemption, Free-Will, Original Sin, falling away totally from Grace, Predeſtination, Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation;</hi> Herein they Diſpute, Quarrel, and Fight each with other, for and about ſuch things as the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>Salvation of Men,</hi> are no ways concern'd in; but Brotherly Love, the Image of God, and mark of a true Chriſtian, is utterly loſt and defaced.</p>
            <p>I have lately read a Book writ by Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Cure of Church-Diviſions,</hi> the third Edition, printed 1670: Whoſe Spirit and Deſign therein, I well approve of, and have unity and amity therewith. He is much againſt that bitter rending, tearing, devouring Spirit that reigneth amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45369:55"/>and will not give the ſame liberty of Conſcience to others in Religious Matters, as they deſire for themſelves. Alſo, he ſaith, <q>There be ſome ſeem wiſe and good themſelves, by making others ſeem fooliſh and bad; and they are all for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but it is only on their narrow factious Tearms; they are for Peace, but it is not of the whole Street, but of their Houſe alone; or not of the whole City, but of their Street alone; He likes not thoſe new-made multiplied Articles of Religion; theſe Additions to Chriſtianity, preſcribed and impoſed on others: This proud Church Tyranny (ſaith he) I doubt not, is the great Cauſe of Schiſm in the World. Love is not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of my Religion, but my Religion it ſelf; God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him: Love is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law, the end of the Goſpel; the nature and mark of Chriſt's Diſciples; the Divine Nature; the Sum of Holineſs to the Lord;</hi> the proper Note to know, what is the Man, and what his State? and how far any of his other <hi>Acts</hi> are acceptable unto God? without which, if we had all Knowledg and Belief, all Gifts of Utterance, and higheſt Profeſſion, we were but as <hi>ſounding Braſs,</hi> and as a <hi>tinkling Cymbal,</hi> &amp;c. Holineſs and Love to God, are but two Names for one Thing. Love to God and to Man, are like Soul and Body, that are ſeparated no way but by death. Sin is hardly known in its ſecret Root, till Men have taſted the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the Fruit. In a word, I have long ſeen that envious Wiſdom (what-ever it pretends) is not from Above, but is earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh; and that where envy and ſtrife is, (upon a Religious Account) there is Confuſion, and every evil Work. That which killeth Love, killeth all Grace and Holineſs, and killeth Souls; that which quencheth Love, quencheth the Spirit, a thouſand-fold more than the reſtraining of our Gifts of Utterance doth. That which baniſheth Love, baniſheth God; that which is againſt Love, is againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt in our Redemption, and therefore may well be called <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> the <hi>White Devil</hi> is a Love-killer as well as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45369:56"/>the <hi>Black;</hi> he is as mortal an Enemy to Love, who backbiteth another, and ſaith he is prophane, or he is an empty Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, or he is a Lukewarm, temporizing, complying Man-pleaſer, as he that ſaith, he is a peeviſh factious Hypocrite. Believe it, it is <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> to fall from Love, your Souls die when Love dieth. To preach without Love, to any that differ from your Sect, O what a loathſome Sacrifice is it to the Lord of Love? When the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had murdered ſo many hundred thouſands of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who would have thought but that they had done their Work? When the <hi>French</hi> Maſſacre had murdered thirty or forty thouſand, and diſpatcht the Leaders of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party, who would have thought that they had but ſtrengthened them? When the <hi>Duke d' Alva</hi> had done ſo much to drown the <hi>Belgick Proteſtants</hi> in Blood, he little thought he was but fortifying them. Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Biſhops, little thought that their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bonefires were but to light Men to ſee the miſchief and badneſs of their Cauſe; and like firing of a Beacon, to call the Land to take them for the Enemies of Mankind. When the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had murdered two hundred thouſand, they little thought that they had but excited the Survivery to a terrible Revenge. I will come no nearer, but you may eaſily do it your ſelves; <hi>If we bite and devour one another, we ſhall be deſtroyed one of another,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and the like faithful and true Sayings the Book is full of, which are well worth the reading, with due Conſideration had thereon. And as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> intimates, <q>That he which ſuffers for his Religion, ſheweth he hath the better Religion than thoſe that cauſe Sufferings: And our patient Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Suffering by them, may tend at laſt to open their Eyes, and turn their Hearts, and ſave their Souls; for the Blood of Martyrs hath ever bin the Seed of the Church; which Seed hath ever encreaſed the number of the Sufferers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many other good Inſtructions, and Directions (both to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People) hath he in this Book ſet forth, for uniting (in Love and Amity) different Perſwaſions, into one Principle of Love, well worth the taking notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:45369:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>And now, my dear Brethren, as I am a Prieſt unto God, by having Chriſt Jeſus, the Eternal Spirit of Truth, in me, I am thereby enabled to hold forth an Exhortation to all of you, which (in the Bowels of the extenſive Love of God towards you) I earneſtly pray you may receive. I know there is amongſt you, a Worthy, Righteous, and Sober People, who I can bear you record, have a Zeal of God, according to the ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of your outward Forms and Worſhips whereby you are diſtinguiſhed: Nevertheleſs I have a few things againſt you; namely, That you have the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt amongſt you, with reſpect of particular Perſons, outward Forms, and carnal Obſervations. Hence ariſe all thoſe Strifes and Contentions, thoſe bitter Revilings, and evil Cenſures, that have abounded amongſt you, both towards each other in your divided Forms, and alſo toward all others that are not concerned with you, as under your diſtinct Attainments. But I teſtify and declare to you, and to the whole World, That if <hi>any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature;</hi> and as <hi>many as walk according to this Rule</hi> of the <hi>New Creature, Peace be upon them, as upon the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God;</hi> and in every Nation, Sect, Form, and Opinion, He <hi>that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi> 'Tis neither here nor there; in this, nor that, neither in the Mountains of Form and Worſhip that you have raiſed to your ſelves, nor at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that God will be now worſhipped; but every where in Spirit and in Truth, is the Worſhip that he accepts.</p>
            <p>Give therefore the Spirit of God his due Scope and Latitude, to blow where, when, and how it liſteth in every Man. 'Tis the great Controverſy that God hath with the World at this day, That he alone may reign in the Conſciences of Men, by the juſt Meaſure of his own Light in every one: And till this <hi>Royal Prerogative</hi> be ſetled upon Him, there will never be Peace on the Earth, but Men ſhall rend, tear, and devour one another; and thoſe that lead into Captivity, muſt themſelves go into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: herein will the Patience, Love, and Charity of the Saints
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45369:57"/>be exerciſed and encreaſed. <hi>Allelujah.</hi> Wherefore <hi>let your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration be known to all Men; the Lord is at hand.</hi> Be not (O be not) found ſmiting your fellow Servants in the day of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance! The Spirit of God (which hath ſealed you to the day of Redemption) is a tender Spirit, O do not grieve it in your ſelves, nor endeavour to quench it in others. If thus you can come forth amongſt Men, you ſhall be a bleſſing in your Generation, a <hi>Light to them that ſit in darkneſs,</hi> and a Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Mourners of <hi>Zion,</hi> who languiſh in the Breaches and Diviſions that have bin made upon her Inhabitants.

            <p>IN the Year 1666, feeling the Babe of Grace (the Word in the Heart) to wax ſtrong in the Love of God ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in my Heart, I ſent to the Poor of your People <hi>Thirty pounds;</hi> which after ſome of your Leaders had received, (to wit, <hi>John Bolton, Gerad Roberts,</hi> and <hi>Amos Stoddard</hi>) and given under their hands accordingly, 'twas denied to be received; and about a Year after returned to me again, with many evil opprobrious Names; which makes me ſay, That <hi>I went to my Own, but my Own would not receive me, but ſold me into</hi> Egypt (by their many falſe Reports.) And poor <hi>Joſeph</hi> found no greater Enemies than his Brethren were. Nevertheleſs the Lord my God did not forſake me, but found me out in the Innocency wherewith he had cloathed me, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me in all my ſtraits, and was my Strength, my Joy, and Crown of Glory; and at length brought me forth of Priſon to ſtand before Princes, aſſiſting and carrying me with much Courage, and through great Oppoſition, to bear and finiſh my Teſtimony to Chriſt in the Saints. And being caſt out from my Brethren, the Lord my God took me up, and became my Teacher, under whoſe Teachings I felt more of the Love of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed more in knowledg of the Things of God, than when I ſat under the Teachings of Men; by whoſe Teachings I grew
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45369:58"/>in Wiſdom and in Stature, unto the Meaſure of a perfect Man in Chriſt Jeſus; then I came to know, that out of <hi>Egypt</hi> God hath called his Son, to whom he hath given, not only the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> but the whole World for his Poſſeſſion and Inheritance. In which Spirit of the Son, I call to mind the ſweet Union and Communion I had with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when they preached Chriſt the Light in every one that cometh into the World, the Way to God the Father of Lights; which Light ſprang up ſo ſtrongly in my Heart, that (with St. <hi>Paul</hi>) it ſtruck me down to the Ground, where I felt the Root of the Matter in my Self, ſo that I needed no Man to teach me; but as the Unction, that ſmall grain of Muſtard-Seed grew to a great Tree, on whoſe body did hang all my Sins, my Weakneſſes, and Infirmities; which Seed of the Kingdom begot in me a new Heart, and placed within me a right Spirit, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, fill'd with the Love of God. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>

            <p>In the day when the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> were ſmall in their own Eyes, I dearly loved them; who did not only preach Chriſt the Truth and Light in every one, but with much boldneſs and courage, and through great Perſecutions, defended the ſame, living in much Love and Amity one with another, (which to me was a moſt lovely ſight to ſee); till there came to be a difference between <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>George Fox;</hi> then <hi>G. F.</hi> by reaſon of his Enmity and Self-exaltation, envied and perſecuted <hi>J. N.</hi> and begat a moſt bitter wrathful Spirit in all his Friends againſt <hi>J. N.</hi> and all that ſtood by him in his Sufferings. Thus <hi>G. F.</hi> was the Father that begat all thoſe Diviſions, Rendings, and Tearings that were then amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (and ſince to this very day); which with great violence laſted till <hi>J. N.</hi> took all the blame on himſelf, and made himſelf of no reputation, who was circumciſed in Heart and Soul; in which Circumciſion he lived and died, a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Party continued acting in another manner of Spirit; for I have ſeen thoſe pull, hale, and carry out of their Synagogue at the <hi>Bull and Mouth,</hi> one <hi>Richard Freeman;</hi> and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45369:58"/>the chief in this work was <hi>John Bolton,</hi> with divers others. At this time I perfectly ſaw, that God had divided in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſcattered in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that a ſeparation was making betwixt the Precious and the Vile, amongſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And was it not the ſame bitter perſecuting Spirit in <hi>G. F.</hi> that writ againſt <hi>J. Perrot</hi>'s Book, called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Amity?</hi> For did not <hi>G. F.</hi> ſay, <hi>This Book was writ with</hi> Cain<hi>'s Spirit?</hi> Crying againſt his Sottiſhneſs and Ignorance, affirming, That a Cloud had compaſſed him, that he went in the way of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that his Spirit would give up the Children of God to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. Further alleaging, That <hi>J. P.</hi> is one of <hi>Ham</hi>'s Stock, and that his groſs Lies proceeded from a deviliſh helliſh Spirit, and that <hi>none that are in the leaſt Truth will believe him;</hi> and that he is a Liar and a Deceiver. And the great Offence <hi>G. F.</hi> takes at this Book, is, that <hi>J. P.</hi> owns the Spirit of God's Grace and Light, to be in <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Seekers,</hi> and others; alſo, that he hath Unity and Amity with all that walk therein; the which <hi>G. F.</hi> denying, and calling it <hi>a Lye,</hi> &amp;c. plainly ſhews, he is an Enemy to all that will not bow down to him, and call him Maſter, or Father of their Spirits; and that he is turned from the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and that he is removed to another Goſpel than what at firſt himſelf had preached; and alſo writ againſt <hi>J. P.</hi> that he was like a Dog, ſnarling and biting ſuch as are in the Life of Truth, and ſo like a Dog thinks he will die. This and much more hath <hi>G. F.</hi> writ againſt <hi>J. P.</hi> purſuing and hunting him (as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>David</hi>) like a Partridg on the Mountains, from Country to Country, from Region to Region, and from City to City, whitherſoever he went, theſe venemous Arrows were ſhot againſt him.</p>
            <p>At this time I perfectly ſaw a Star fall from Heaven, called <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> or the <hi>Dragon</hi>'s <hi>Tail,</hi> with which he drew to the Ground a third part of the Stars of Heaven; then I ſaw a War in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (a Religious War) the <hi>Dragon</hi> againſt the <hi>Lamb; Michael</hi> and his Angels fought againſt the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angels. Which bitter Spirit of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> did write or indite <hi>John Bolton</hi>'s Book,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45369:59"/>printed 1670, intituled, <hi>Judas and his Treachery,</hi> &amp;c. In which Book, he ſaith, <hi>The thirty pounds</hi> Robert Rich <hi>ſent to the Poor amongst the</hi> Quakers, <hi>was the price of Blood, and</hi> Judas <hi>his Treachery; That</hi> Robert Rich <hi>is a Vagabond on the Earth, one that hath not an Habitation in the Living God; That he is a Contender againſt God's Bleſſed and Holy Way, the Way of Life, with whom</hi> Robert Bacon <hi>is joined; That they were Idolaters, and judged them to be the Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Spirit, and that the Myſtery of Iniquity, in</hi> R. R. <hi>and</hi> R. B. <hi>was brought forth to open view.</hi> And all along his Book is full of the like Expreſſions, not only againſt <hi>R. R.</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> but the ſame Railing Accuſations are alſo againſt Innocent <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> and for no Evil ſaid or done againſt any one of them, as in their own Conſciences they well know. To all which Railing Accuſations, <hi>R. R.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time another Book was writ againſt <hi>R. R.</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> by <hi>Ger. Roberts, Geo. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>E. H.</hi> intituled, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency and Ranteriſm rebuked;</hi> in which they call the Spirit of <hi>R. R.</hi> which ſent thirty pounds to their Poor, <hi>A drunken ranting Spirit, a fained Love;</hi> and the Gift they call <hi>Cain</hi>'s <hi>Sacrifice, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack's Reward,</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>Wages, Judas</hi>'s <hi>Oblation,</hi> and a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Idolatrous Gift.</hi> Alſo that <hi>R. R.</hi> is <hi>a wandring Star, a raging Wave of the Sea;</hi> that <hi>he is a Sow wallowing in the Mire, a Dog caſting up his Vomit;</hi> that <hi>he is that Fool, which ſaith in his Heart there is no God; and bray a Fool in a Mortar, and he will never be the wiſer; and that this folly hath bin with him ever ſince the days of</hi> J.N. All this, and much more, for nought elſe than for <hi>R. R.</hi> his Gift to the Poor of their People. Which Language, let <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Friends well conſider whether it proceeded from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lamb that loves Enemies, or from the Dragon that caſts his Floods after the Man-Child to devour him, who is the only begotten of God in the Saints, he muſt rule and reign, though <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Men of War never ſo much rave and rage? I ſay, that the only begotten of God, by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt in the Saints, the Virgin Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> muſt ſurely rule &amp; reign. Even ſo, <hi>Amen. Allelujah.</hi>

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:45369:59"/>What had you againſt <hi>J. N.</hi> more than that God had taken away his Judgment from him, and then led him into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be tried and tempted by <hi>G. F.</hi> and others, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by that Spirit that then ruled in the Children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who in all meekneſs and patience did bear and ſuffer the enmity and cruelty of all his Perſecutors as a good Example?</p>
            <p>And what had you againſt <hi>R. R.</hi> more than that he ſtood by <hi>J. N.</hi> in his Sufferings, and for pulling off his Hat at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord, as a ſign of Love to them that underſtood that ſign better, than if he had ſaluted after your mode and faſhion in giving the Hand: Alſo that he pulled off his Hat, which was to teſtify that the Hat might be made an Idol, both in keeping it on, and in pulling it off.</p>
            <p>And what had you againſt <hi>J. P.</hi> more than for owning the Light of Chriſt in <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Baptiſts, Seekers,</hi> and others, even in all that believed in it, and followed it? And is not the Light of Chriſt in every one, the Enſign, to gather together all of every Sect and Nation, thoſe that follow it, into Unity with the Lord, and Amity one with another? And why was <hi>G. F.</hi> ſo bitter againſt <hi>J.P.</hi> for declaring, that no ſuch beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Hat off or on, is any part of God's Worſhip? And if <hi>G. F.</hi> muſt be obeyed in theſe things, rather than the Light of Chriſt in our ſelves; whether then <hi>G. F.</hi> and his preſcribed and impoſed Forms, be not the greateſt Idol that ever was ſet up by a Profeſſing People? let the Witneſs of God in every one be Judg.</p>
            <p>I have lately read a Manuſcript, ſubſcribed <hi>George Fox,</hi> writ to all that would know what thoſe People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are, and ſhewing their Experiences which they have ſeen, and gone through, to Prieſts and Profeſſors: Which Paper contains fifty Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>In the firſt and ſecond <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>We thought it a hard thing for</hi> Cain <hi>to kill Righteous</hi> Abel; <hi>but when we look'd within our ſelves, we ſaw that envious wrathful Man that ſlew every appearance of God within, and ready to ſlay the Righteous without.</hi> Then <hi>G. F.</hi> goes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45369:60"/>on, ſpeaks againſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and againſt <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, for ſelling of him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. and tells Prieſts and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, <hi>That if they look within, they ſhall find this Nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> And I tell <hi>G. F.</hi> that he need not go ſo far to ſeek this evil Nature in Prieſts and Profeſſors. Let him look but within himſelf, and conſider his own Actings againſt his Innocent Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and he will find <hi>Cain</hi>'s Nature <hi>there,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sin to lie at his <hi>own Door,</hi> and will know him that ſold <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. And this Spirit was the Cauſe of <hi>G. F</hi>'s own Fall, who was once an Angel of Light, and had a place in Heaven, but is fallen from thence like Lightning, and is now become an Angel of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, where he rules and governs over all that have not their Names written in the Lambs Book of Life, continuing their forms of Godlineſs, their long Preachings, and long Prayers from the Comprehenſion of Truth, but not with the Life and Power thereof; thus ye ſuffer that Woman <hi>Jezebel,</hi> which calls her ſelf a Propheteſs, (by good Words and fair Speeches) to ſeduce and deceive the Innocent amongſt you, keeping them always learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but can never come to the Knowledg of the Truth as it is in Jeſus, unleſs they ceaſe from man's Teachings, and come to the Teachings of God in themſelves, which alone truly teacheth the way to Life and Salvation. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>

            <p>I have alſo read a Teſtimony from the Brethren, met at <hi>London</hi> the third Month 1666, ſubſcribed by eleven of your Miniſtry. Alſo from a Meeting at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the 27th day of the 7th Month 1669, ſubſcribed by 36 Perſons. Alſo from a Meeting at <hi>Ellis Hooks,</hi> the 12th of the 4th Month 1677, againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> ſubſcribed by 66 of your Miniſters. All which in general contain, very bitter Cenſures, and high Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt many of your own People, who have divided from the Body of Friends, (ſo called by your ſelves) wherein you te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, <hi>That thoſe ingaged in the Spirit of Separation, ought not to have any Rule or Dominion in the Church of God, whereof the Holy Spirit that was poured forth upon you,</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>hath made you Overſeers.</hi> But your Fruits will make you more manifeſt than
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45369:60"/>your Words. Alſo, <hi>That all that are joined to that Spirit of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who ſtand not in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with your Miniſtry, their Judgments ought not to be regarded amongst Friends.</hi> And further, <hi>You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your ſelves the Witneſſes and Ambaſſadors of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable Truth, and the Elders of the Church of God, who of right (having kept your Habitations in the Truth) ought to judg of things which differ; and this your Judgment to ſtand good and valid amongst Friends againſt all that oppoſe it.</hi> Alſo, that <hi>if any pretending to be of your Memberſhip, will not admit to be tried, in caſe of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, by the Elders and Members of this your Body, but oppoſe it, (as the Judgment of Man) you then teſtify in the Name of the Lord againſt them, that he or ſhe, with all thoſe that countenance theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers, are to be rejected, as joined in one with Infidels and Heathens.</hi> Theſe (together with <hi>G. F</hi>'s Paper in vindication of Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, dated the 4th Month 1678) impoſing upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men; as alſo the particular Invectives againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> both importing the ſame Spirit of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Rule over the Conſcience, (which is the proper Heritage of God) I have both ſeen, well-weighed, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and while I contemplate your preſent State, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the Principles with which you were firſt inſpired, I cannot but take up that Lamentation concerning you, which the Prophet of old did concerning <hi>Iſrael, How is the Mighty fallen? How is the Gold become dim? the fine Gold, how is it changed? Even the Sea-Monſters draw out the Breaſts, and give ſuck to their young Ones, but the Daughters of my People are become cruel, like the Oſtrich in the Wilderneſs.</hi> O let it be timely conſidered by you, how degenerate you are grown from that Love, Meekneſs, and Simplicity to which you at firſt pretended. Are not you the Men that have in your Doctrine exalted the Meaſure of God in all Men, as the only Guide and Director, in that to abide, and by it to be led, and not by any outward Preſcriptions or Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever? And are not you the Men that now not only impoſe and preſcribe on others, but alſo condemn and cenſure your Innocent Brethren as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> becauſe in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45369:61"/>Conſcience they cannot ſubject themſelves under the Yoke of your Preſcriptions? Are you ſo preſumptuous, as to conclude all knowledg and diſcerning in the Things of God, and all Spiritual Judgment is given into your Hands, that you uſurp the Keys of the Kingdom, and will let none in, but thoſe who ſtand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to your carnal and literal Impoſitions? Is <hi>G. F.</hi> and the Body of his Friends, of greater Authority than <hi>Peter,</hi> (who was an Elder and Pillar of the Church?) whom nevertheleſs <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood, becauſe he did not walk uprightly according to the Truth of the Goſpel, but endeavoured to compel the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (who had their Law within themſelves) to live after the manner and form of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Law ſtood much in outward Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the Letter, as doth <hi>G. F</hi>'s Comely Order. And are <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Friends, ſo bold and daring, as to condemn the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Juſt that went before you in other paſt Ages, under their various Diſpenſations, (and all thoſe Worthies in our preſent Time, who cannot own your Practices, or ſubmit to your Precepts) by concluding them none of the Body of Chriſt, becauſe noneof your Memberſhip? Is the Body of Chriſt now ſhrunk and narrow'd into G. <hi>F</hi>'s Tribe of Members and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? are theſe the Lips only that preſerve Knowledg? are you the only Men that fear God and work Righteouſneſs? and muſt we forſake the inward Teſtimony, to ask the Law from your Mouths? Can any thing be more prodigious and deſtructive to the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus than this Doctrine? or preſent it ſelf with greater horror and amazement to the minds of all rational and ſober Men, and all that truly fear God, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of a neceſſary ſubmiſſion to G. <hi>F.</hi> and his Tribe of Proſelytes, under the penalty of being no otherwiſe eſteemed than <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels?</hi> Do not you in theſe things apparently cloath your ſelves with the Livery and Character of Him who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, by creating a Dominion over your Brethren, and the movings of God in them, and claiming a Power to judg of all Differences, preſcribing Rules and Orders, and putting Yokes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45369:61"/>upon the Necks of your Diſciples, to the ſtifling of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, wounding their Peace, and deſtroying that Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free? If this be the Spirit which you at preſent ſtand in, (as your ſeveral forementioned Papers do plainly import) I dare boldly challenge all that have gone before you, from the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf downward, to all Sects and Opinions extant in the World, to produce, if they can, a greater Inſtance of ſwelling Soveraignty over the Minds and Conſciences of Men, than you have erected. And certainly had you a Secular Power but framed and fitted to your Rule, Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, the World would ſoon feel, that the Finger of your Church-Cenſures, would bear an equal weight (at leaſt) with the Loins of thoſe Perſecutors which have bin your Predeceſſors. Now (all this conſidered) can you in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs conceive that this frame of Spirit (in that abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which you claim to your ſelves over all others) will render you the Healers of our Breaches, and the Reſtorers of our Paths of Peace? Can you think that this Arbitrary and Haughty Government, will invite the Nations and Languages of all Sects and Opinions, to lay hold on your Skirts, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be led by you, becauſe the Lord is with you? Or do they not rather with dread and horror behold you, while you ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily impoſe upon others in ſuch Circumſtances and Indifferencies, wherein the Kingdom of God doth not conſiſt, and make thoſe Rules and Preſcriptions of equal value with Divine Inſtitutions? Witneſs the Hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the outward Garb impoſed upon your Proſelytes: Your Set-times when to begin, and when to end your Religious Exerciſes (notwithſtanding your pretence of the immediate guidance of the Spirit): Your manner of greeting one another, with many things of the like Nature. To all which an exact conformity is required, upon the penalty of a Cenſure from <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Elderſhip.</p>
            <p>Now, dear Friends, can you (in the cool of the Day of God upon your Spirits) believe that this violent and rigid ſort
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45369:62"/>of Practice, will render your Feet beautiful upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains? or will attract the Hearts of any wiſe or ingenuous People towards you? No ſurely, your experience may otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that ſince this violence (of <hi>Eſau</hi> againſt his Brother <hi>Jacob</hi>) hath appeared amongſt you, the Curſe of <hi>Babylon</hi> hath overtaken you, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.9, to the end) even the loſs of Children and Widowhood, which will certainly come upon you in their perfection, as the Witneſs of God ariſeth amongſt thoſe that you have ſo heavily yok'd and burthen'd with your own invented Preſcriptions.</p>
            <p>I have done with you, when I have told you, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations in which God adminiſters Himſelf to the World at this day, do moſt naturally call for a more ſober, moderate, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and loving Spirit amongſt Chriſtians, than this wherein you are exerciſed. You cannot but obſerve how the Lord of Hoſts is pleading with the World in the dreadful Manifeſtations of his Power, (by <hi>Plague, Fire, Sword,</hi> &amp;c.) how He turns the Earth up-ſide down, and makes it reel to and fro like a Drunkard; and the Foundations of the World are out of Courſe, divided and broken, both in their Civil Policies, and Religious Practices. Fear, the Pit and a Snare, have laid hold on the Inhabitants of the Earth, there is no Eſtabliſhment in their Paths, and the way of Peace they know not: Yea, this is the day of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and for the Diviſions of <hi>Reuben,</hi> there are great ſearchings of Heart; God is now pleading in Judgment with the People that have bin called by his Name, ſearching <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and Judgment is already begun at the houſe of God; He is about to judg the Spiritual Pride and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, the Cruelty and Oppreſſion, the Hypocriſy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality that hath mingled it ſelf with all the fair and beautiful Profeſſions of thoſe that have bin called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And what will you ſay (my Friends) if in <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Skirts be found the Blood of the Souls of the poor Innocent? (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Now if this be the proper Work of the Almighty at this day (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45369:62"/>all that are not either blinded with Carnal Intereſt, or lull'd into a formal Security, muſt needs acknowledg); Can you yet be ſo vainly confident, as to perſwade your ſelves that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Evil ſhall come near your Borders, whilſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of God's Judgments fly ſo thick in the World, and ſtick ſo deep in the Hearts and ſides of all, both Civil and Religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts? Are you, and your Impoſing Tribe, the only Men that muſt eſcape, when the whole World is to be ſet on Fire, yea, the very Heavens of Profeſſors are to be burnt up, and nothing to be left alive in us, but what can lie down in thoſe Flames? Is there nothing, think ye, in or amongſt your People that is for Judgment? Or, is this a time for you to build (and raiſe a Name to your ſelves) when God is deſtroying? to contend for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rule and Dominion over others, when God is pleading his own Royal Prerogative? to ſit in judgment over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of your Brethren, when the Judg ſtands at the Door? Or are ye ſo regardleſs of the prints and footſteps of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his preſent Providences, that ye ſay in your Hearts, with that Evil Servant, <hi>The Lord delays his coming?</hi> and fall to ſmiting your fellow Servants with the Tongue and Fiſt of Wickedneſs, wounding and reproaching them with your bitter and ſevere Cenſures, thinking (with the evil Huſbandman) therewith to kill and ſlay the Heir, the Seed of God in Man, that muſt rule and reign? Surely (my Friends) the tempeſtuous Storms of Wrath and Indignation that you ſee falling upon the World, do earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call for a more mild and ſober Spirit amongſt you than this: <hi>Let</hi> therefore <hi>your Moderation be known to all Men; the Lord is at hand.</hi> If you would be a bleſſing to the World in your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, learn firſt to judg and condemn your ſelves: Caſt off your Judging, Cenſuring, and Impoſing Spirit, and give the Witneſs of God in every one its juſt Right, its due Scope and Latitude, and uſurp not Authority over it: Take not upon you to be Lords over God's Heritage; let the Bowels of your Love and Tenderneſs be drawn out and extended towards the meaſure
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45369:63"/>of God in all Men of every Religion, in forbearance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs to the whole World; follow Peace in the Spirit of Love with all Men, and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee God. Give <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Prerogative in Spirituals, He muſt and will have it; Give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due in Temporals, who may of undoubted right challeng it. Thus if you can commend your ſelves to God and the World, ye ſhall be the Joy of this Generation; all good Men will be drawn out in an earneſt imitation of your Purity, while the violent and wicked ſhall ſtand mute, and be ſtruck dumb at your modeſt Patience and Meekneſs; you ſhall never want either inward Peace, or outward Freedom, but ye ſhall enter into Peace and Reſt in your Beds, each one walking in his Uprightneſs. This (my dear Friends) is the Teſtimony in which I long to meet you, and which will juſtly provoke the hearty embraces of</p>

               <salute>Dear Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing moved in my Spirit, in the Year 1666, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Seed of God, the Seed of the Promiſe in all Men, and in particular the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> namely, the <hi>Roman;</hi> the <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtant;</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> the <hi>Independent;</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> the <hi>Quaker;</hi> and the <hi>Church of the Firſt-Born;</hi> to each of them I gave <hi>Thirty pounds,</hi> to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt the Poor of their People, as a ſign of my dear Love to the Seed of God in all, which I ſaw lay crucified, dead, and buried in ſome, and in others riſen and reigning into Life
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45369:64"/>that is Eternal. That which principally moved me to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salutation, was, the ſad and ſerious apprehenſion of the Straits and Limits by which I ſaw the Seed of God held in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and theſe ſeveral ſorts of Profeſſors to value themſelves, and alſo condemn one another, in reference to thoſe Modes and Methods of Worſhip and Obedience, in which they are divided and diſtinguiſhed. My Salutation intended a cheek to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſeverity amongſt them; and according to the inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from God upon my Spirit (if poſſible) to let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that our gracious God is no reſpecter of Perſons, Sects, or Opinions, but of every Nation, thoſe that fear God and work Righteouſneſs, are accepted of him; and that all thoſe that walk in the Light of the Lord, wherewith he hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, are ſaved. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Heavenly Revelation of this Bleſſed Viſion, wherein I felt and found my ſelf in a through Reconcilement to all Sorts and Sects of Men, I have begun, and now finiſhed my <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to theſe <hi>Seven States of Chriſtians,</hi> which I recommend to the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light,</hi> to read and to conſider what the Spirit ſaith to the <hi>Churches.</hi> And becauſe in the Travels of this Teſtimony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul, I have met with ſeveral Celeſtial Pilgrims journying towards <hi>Sion,</hi> with their Faces thitherward, by whoſe ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, in many of their Books and Papers, I have bin often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and comforted: I cannot but commend, both their Names and Labours, to the ſober Enquirers after Truth; as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though theſe Witneſſes are dead and gone, yet their Spirits and Teſtimony remain, and ſtill ſpeak to us. At this time I read many Books writ by the Divine Spirit, in which I took great delight, ſome few whereof I find freedom to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate on.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Cebes</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> Philoſopher, his Table writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> (ſince tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi>) who lived <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3553; which Table was hung up in the Temple of <hi>Saturn.</hi> This Table conſiſted of three Parks or Incloſures; at the Gate of the firſt ſtood the ſhape of an Old Man, called <hi>Life's Genius,</hi> (afterwards
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45369:64"/>
               <hi>True Inſtruction</hi>) which I underſtand by interpretation, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Light and Grace of God, which appeareth to and in every one. This Light, or <hi>Life's Genius,</hi> taught and inſtructed all how they ſhould lead their Lives, according to thoſe Rules he directed, both to avoid temptations to Vice, and to imbrace all thoſe Divine Vertues that lead to Beatitude.</p>
            <p>I have read the <hi>Imitation of Chriſt,</hi> writ by <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Kempis.</hi> Alſo Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> his firſt, ſecond, and third <hi>Rule of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and his <hi>Idiot;</hi> with others of the like Divine Nature, all tending to a Holy Life, by virtue of Chriſt's Holy Spirit in us, the only way to Life and Salvation. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have alſo read many Divine Works writ by <hi>H. N. Jacob Behm, John Saltmarſh,</hi> Dr. <hi>Everard, William Sedgwick, William Erbery,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> with others that were inſpired of God, and ſpake of the ſecond Coming of Chrit in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and of that bleſſed Day which ſhould attend his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have alſo read, with much delight, two Books writ by <hi>J. N.</hi> called, <hi>Love to the Loſt,</hi> and, <hi>A Salutation to the Seed of God in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo one ſmall Book writ by <hi>John Perrot,</hi> entituled, <hi>An Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for the moſt pure Amity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Spirit and Life of God, to all ſincere-hearted Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have likewiſe lately read ſome Prophecies and Predictions of that Holy Learned Man <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh;</hi> who through Inſpiration of God's Spirit, ſpake of many things which long after came to paſs: that which is to me moſt remarkable in that Sheet of Paper is, that he being intreated to write in brief of <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> deſired he might be excuſed; notwithſtanding the Perſon ſoliciting, through importunity, obtained a promiſe: A while after his Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claimed, he replied, <q>He had not writ, yet could not charge himſelf with breach of Promiſe, for <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I did begin to write, but when I came to write of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that is, of the New Creature which God formeth by his Spirit in every
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45369:65"/>Soul which he doth truly regenerate, I found ſo little wrought of it in my ſelf, that I could ſpeak of it, only as a Parrot by rote, without knowledg and underſtanding, and therefore durſt not proceed any further upon it. <hi>Adding,</hi> I muſt tell you, we do not well underſtand what <hi>Sanctification</hi> and the <hi>New Birth</hi> is; It is no leſs than for a Man to be brought to an entire Reſignation of his own Will to the Will of God, and to live in the offering up of his Soul continually in the flames of Love, as a holy burnt Offering to Chriſt. And how little <hi>(ſays he)</hi> are many of thoſe that profeſs Chriſtianity, experimentally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Work of Regeneration in their Souls? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he deſires his Friend to look he be not found a Worſhipper in the outward Court; which outward Court <hi>(ſays he)</hi> is the formal Chriſtian, whoſe Religion lies in performing the out-ſide Duties of Chriſtianity, without having an inward Life and Power of Faith and Love uniting them to Chriſt; and theſe God will leave to be trodden down and ſwept away by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> the Prophane that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but are the Synagogue of <hi>Satan.</hi> The Worſhippers within the Temple, and before the Altar, are thoſe that do worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, whoſe Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured and adored in the moſt inward Thoughts of their Hearts; and they Sacrifice their Luſts and vile Affections, yea, and their own Wills to him, and theſe God will hide in the hollow of his Hand, and under the ſhadow of his Wings, and ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a Seed, to partake of that Glory which ſhall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follow.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have alſo lately read two Treatiſes writ by Sir <hi>Henry Vane;</hi> Firſt, <hi>An Epiſtle General to the Mystical Body of Chriſt on Earth, the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal in Babylon.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>The Face of the Times.</hi> Wherein he well diſcovers the Riſe, Progreſs, and Iſſue, of the Enmity and Conteſt between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent. He ſaith, <q>That till the Seventh Trump ſound, 1666, the Woman's Seed muſt ſuffer; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Seed of the Woman being riſen with Chriſt, muſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45369:65"/>reign with him; and then the Head of the Serpent ſhould be bruiſed.</q> He ſpeaketh moſt excellently of the firſt and ſecond Covenant, and of a ſingle and double Portion of the Spirit, of Regeneration and Reſtoration into the firſt Eſtate in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which may fall; alſo of the New Creation, or Second Birth, (the Seed of God in Man) which endures, and never will, nor ever can fall. <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaith, <q>The <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle is, To reſtore out of the Fall into the firſt State, who though they are Angels, yet may fall. He ſhews how Angels fell, who through pride oppoſe all higher Lights than themſelves, and that ſuch fallen Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greateſt Enemies to the Birth of Chriſt in the Saints; which Spirit is the great Antichriſt, the Old Serpent, the Devil, that is to be caſt into the Bottomleſs-Pit, with all his Angels; who outwardly appear as Angels of Light, but inwardly they devour the Innocent.</q> This I have ſeen to be a Truth, in the bitter conteſts betwixt <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Angels, and the ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, humble, meek Spirit that was in <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> and thoſe that ſuffered with them, for bearing their Teſtimony to Chriſt in the Saints, which is the laſt, the moſt glorious and higheſt Diſpenſation (<hi>as ſaith Sir</hi> H. V.) now at the very Doors; a Truth which many can Witneſs. <hi>He further ſaith,</hi> 
               <q>The Lamb will overcome by Sufferings; and that the firſt ſign of Chriſt's ſecond Coming, is diſtreſs of Nations; that the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherds of the Earth daſhing one againſt the other, wil lmake way for Chriſt's Reign; in which War, none but Hypocrites and Apoſtates (which make the outward Court) will ſuffer, whilſt God's People will be preſerved in Peace and Safety.</q> 
               <hi>Sir</hi> H. V. <hi>alſo ſaith,</hi> 
               <q>The Holy City and Temple meaſured, are Saints in Power: That the Woman clothed with the Sun, is Chriſt's dead Body raiſed. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, (he ſaith)</hi> are the two great Lights, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> when they meet in our Hearts. It is <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> a fickle and fooliſh Religion, that depends on the Magiſtrates Power, either to ſet up or pull down. That Believers Rewards in Sufferings, is inward Peace
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45369:66"/>and Joy in a ſerene quiet Mind.</q> He was alſo in his day a great Prophet, <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Captivity is near an end, at which time the Sons of God ſhall be made manifeſt; ſo ſoon as that is come, there will need little other help than the Grave it ſelf to caſt them forth, as the Womb doth the Fruit; then ſhall you know the Lord is God when he hath opened and brought you up out of your Graves; ſuch will the Lord own viſibly for his People, by putting his wonderful Spirit in them, and then will God's Indignation be poured out upon his Enemies. That the Nation that hath kept the Seed of God in Bondage, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf God will judg more ſignally than he did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> in this day ſhall the Tabernacle of God in Men be viſible. <hi>He alſo ſaith,</hi> Doubtleſs great and precious Promiſes are to be accompliſhed in and upon Believers here on Earth, to the making of Chriſt admired in them. That this dark Night and black Shade, that God hath drawn over his work in the midſt of us, may be the Ground Colour to ſome beautiful Piece that he is now expoſing to the light. That ſurely God hath a glorious Deſign to carry on in the World, even the building of <hi>David</hi>'s Throne to all Generations. I know a Day of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for <hi>Sion</hi> will come, not with confuſed noiſe of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, and Garments rouling in Blood, but with burning and fuel of Fire in the Conſciences of Men. Men they may fight againſt, but this they can never fight againſt. The Day approaches wherein God will decide his Controverſy with the World, not by outward Might and Power, but by the Spirit of the Living God. <hi>'Twas an uſual ſaying with him,</hi> Come what would, every thing was upon the right Wheel, in the wiſe contrivement of God, for the accompliſhing of his Righteous Deſigns in the World.</q> 
               <hi>And ſpeaking to his Children, ſaith,</hi> 
               <q>Regard not the Reproaches that are fallen on your Father, ſay, or do Men what they will, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith will find the Bleſſing <hi>Abraham</hi> found.</q> Theſe, and many more of His, as of Others, I take to be true and faithful Sayings, meet to be conſidered by all that wait for, and expect Redemption, Conſolation, and Salvation from the God of <hi>Iſrael. Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:45369:66"/>You will not blame me, that I have enlarged upon the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of theſe Holy Men, that have finiſhed their Courſe, kept the Faith, and are gone before us into the Eternal Manſions of Glory; who having quitted their Mortal Fabricks, are flown into the World of hidden Wonders. The Spirits of theſe Juſt Men made perfect, are now upon you, ye are come up to them, and in the harmonious Fellowſhip of that Spirit, (which is now one and the ſame amongſt all the Sanctified,) I have a few words of my inward Breathings to communicate to your holy Experiences.</p>
            <p>In a deep ſenſe thereof, of my endeared Love towards that Royal Seed that richly dwells in you, I here ſalute you, and give you to underſtand, That my Soul is firmly knit and united to that Principle of Life in which you ſtand, bearing your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the Truth, before God and Man, amongſt a crooked and perverſe Generation; who only dwell upon the out-ſide talks and pretences to God, Religion and Chriſtianity, but hate even to Blood and Violence, all thoſe that are the free-born Seed of the Promiſe; whoſe Faith and Obedience ſtands not in the Will, Work, or Wiſdom of Man, but in the Power and Spirit of God, mightily working in their Hearts and Conſciences, whereby they are indeed purified, waſhed, and cleanſed from dead Works to ſerve the Living God. And ſo much the more is my Heart inflamed towards you, when I conſider you in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</p>
            <p>Firſt, To the Nature of your preſent Station.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, To thoſe great Deſigns that God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you for.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the Nature of your preſent Station, I behold you (not as <hi>Moah, Jer.</hi> 48.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but) as a People ſtanding in a more inward nearneſs with God; than the reſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Tribes of Religious Proſelytes in the World; a People that have bin ſcattered from all your fleſhly Comforts and Confidences in all thoſe Joys, Hopes, Helps, and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein you have truſted, below God. You have bin
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45369:67"/>led into the Deeps of God's Wonders, while others have bin only wading in the ſhallow Streams of a literal and formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: Unto you it is given to know thoſe Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, which lie hid from others in dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Parables; you know that the Son of God is come, and hath given you an underſtanding to know him that is True, and that ye are in Him that is True, which is the very God and Eternal Life. You cannot be deceived with the tinkling Noiſes, or glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Baits of, <hi>Loe here,</hi> or <hi>Loe there,</hi> for the Kingdom of God is within you. In a word, there is nothing below Spirit, Power, and Subſtance, that can either crown your longing Expectations, or reward your holy Breathings after Truth, with a plenary and full ſatisfaction. Thus as the Lord's Lillies among Thorns, ſo do you ſtand among the formal Daughters, being preſerved in your Station, upheld in your Principles, and as Beacons flaming with the holy Blazes of a free and univerſal Love, ſerve to enlighten the World into the way of Truth, and direct their Feet into the Paths of that Peace, Amity, Union, Reſt, and Security, to which as yet they are ſo much eſtranged.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the other Conſideration of the Great Work, and High Deſigns which God hath prepared you for. And ſurely glorious Things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God! You are not only as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> beautiful for Scituation, but alſo the Joy of the whole Earth, for thoſe humble, gentle, lovely, and pleaſant Aſpects, by which you ſhine upon the whole World, with the inviting and aſtoniſhing Charms of a divinely inſpired Love and Affection; You are a People fitted above all others to be a Bleſſing to the World; the whole Creation ſeems to groan and travel in pain, with a longing and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expectation to be delivered into the glorious Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Ye ſtand. O how hath the form and out-ſide of Religion, (mixed with Carnal Intereſt) expoſed the World to Extremities of Horror and Confuſion, as at this day? What indignity and reproach doth indelebly ſtick upon the Skirts of Profeſſion and Chriſtianity, through that fiery and miſ-guided Zeal, thoſe Feuds
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45369:67"/>and bitter Animoſities, that Strife and Debate, that Blood and Violence which abounds amongſt thoſe that walk under the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Names of Goſpel-Profeſſors and True Chriſtians? How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, lifeleſs, and unſavory is the whole ſtate of formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion grown, who while they cry up a Chriſt that died for them, and contend for an Hiſtorical Faith of his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, hoping to be ſaved by a bare Imputation of a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought without them, and yet know nothing all this while of any inward change, or renewedneſs of Mind and Heart; but totally ignorant of the inward active and real Righteouſneſs, which ſhould commend them to the World in an healing, ſaving, comforting, and refreſhing Spirit? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the higher People are advanced in a literal and carnal Knowledg of God and Chriſt, the more rough, bitter, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere will their temper be towards all others that differ from them in the leaſt Circumſtances of Religion, it being natural to that Knowledg and Wiſdom, to ſwell and puff up the Mind in the lofty and high conceits of a ſelf-Righteouſneſs, rather than ſweeten and ſoften the Spirit in that Charity which edifies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, this is the diſtracted Station wherein the Children of Form are truly preſented (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine) tearing and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring each other in this day of Wrath: for now is the Judgment of this World; and what may quench theſe Flames? what may quel theſe Diſorders? what may repair theſe Breaches, or allay theſe Diſtempers, is the main thing that would be moſt deſirable to know?</p>
            <p>We ſee that neither the Prudence of Princes, nor the Policies of Government (the Preſcriptions of the wiſeſt Reformers, nor the beſt eſteemed Regularities of the moſt magnified Authors, and reverend Fathers) are capable to accompliſh this Reconciling Work: Nay, the Sacred Oracle of the Scripture it ſelf, is ſo far ſhort of obtaining this bleſſed End, that all different Parties do endeavour, with the greateſt induſtry imaginable, (by warping and winding the Text) not only to ſuit it to the occaſion of their preſent Differences, but alſo thereby to juſtify their mad,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45369:68"/>blind, and uncharitable Zeal towards each other: What Remedy then is left us in this Diſtreſs? Is there no Balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> Yes certainly, for although the extent of our Wounds and Breaches are too wide and great for the moſt ample Wiſdom and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Man to heal and cement, there is yet largeneſs enough in the eternal and univerſal Love of God to accompliſh this great Work, and to make his <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Praiſe upon the Earth: And 'tis (my dear Brethren) by the ample and large manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Univerſal Love, ſhed abroad in your Hearts, that this great Deſign of God muſt be accompliſhed; and oh how the Conſideration of this Glorious Work, (in and by you to be brought forth) doth draw out my Spirit towards you. <hi>Awake, awake then, put on thy ſtrength, O Sion, put on thy beautiful Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thou Holy City; ſtand forth thou Virgin Daughter, clothed with the ſtrength of the Divine Majeſty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Glory of your Principles, by the beauty of your Practices to the World.</hi> There is Majeſty enough in that Love which fills and feeds your Souls, to confound the Cruelty of all your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, to ſhame and aſtoniſh the World into ſilence and ſtilneſs; and of this let us be confident, that how-ever the over-flowing Tides of common Calamities (blown up by the raging breath of formal and carnal Intereſts) may ſwell as a Flood upon the World, yet no Weapon that is form'd againſt Love (to Truth and Righteouſneſs) ſhall proſper; the <hi>Heathen</hi> may rage, and the People may imagine a vain Thing: The Kings of the Earth may Plot, Conſpire, and take Counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed; yet the Lord hath ſet his King upon his Holy Hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> and he ſhall and doth Rule and Reign in the midſt of his Enemies: Let it therefore appear to the World, whoſe Subjects ye are, whoſe Banner ye are under, and what Motto it bears, which is, <hi>Glory to God in the Higheſt, on: Earth Peace, and good Will towards Men.</hi> O how beautiful will thoſe feet be upon the Mountains, which are ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace; <hi>How beautiful are thy Feet with Shooes, O Princes Daughter?</hi> Cant. 7.1. How amiable and pleaſant will
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45369:68"/>your Lives and Teſtimonies be among Men, when you come forth in the largeneſs of that Love, Meekneſs, and Humility, in Forbearance and Forgiveneſs, which are the proper Ornaments, and moſt natural Inſtances of a true Goſpel-Profeſſion? In the Name of God ariſe then, and ſhew your ſelves (in his ſtrength) to be that in Power and Life, which the World are only in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Notion; let it be known by the lively and active de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Spirit of God in you, <hi>That greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the World:</hi> Your Principles I am ſure are more noble, extenſive, and generous; do but draw them forth, and ſhew them to open view, and you will be a Bleſſing in your Generation; The ſeveral Tribes and Languages ſhall faſten on your Skirts, and ſay, <hi>We will go along with you, for the Lord is amongst you:</hi> Nay, even the <hi>Kings of the Nations ſhall ſhut their Mouths at this appearance of God in you,</hi> Iſa. 52.14, 15. <hi>For that which had not bin told them, they ſhall ſee, and that which they had not heard, they ſhall conſider.</hi> (As <hi>Pharach</hi> ſaid of <hi>Joſeph, Where is there a Man in whom the Spirit of God is? Gen.</hi> 41.38, &amp;c.) Finally, my Brethren, <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; put on the whole Armour of God, for your Work and your Warfare requires it;</hi> and ye know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below that can enable you to finiſh this your Teſtimony: <hi>Ye wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood; neither are the Weapons of your Warfare Carnal, but mighty through God, to ſubdue every high Thought, and vain Imagination.</hi> All thoſe Principalities and Powers, and thoſe ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places, which have captivated the Royal Seed of the Promiſe, and exalted themſelves againſt the free Breathings of the Spirit; Theſe (my dear Friends) are the powerful Enemies, over which ye muſt be more than Conquerors through him that loves you; and when in the ſtrength of this Love you have ſubdued the World, calm'd and quieted that wild and furious Spirit of Wrath that is let looſe among Men, and prepared the way for the Kingdom of God, and of his Chriſt, to be eſtabliſh'd in us, and amongſt us; what remains, but that in a holy denial of your Selves and Services,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45369:69"/>(your Gifts and Graces, your Love and Enlargements, your Faith and Patience, your Sufferings and Perſeverances) you offer up the Son of the Promiſe, and caſt down theſe your Crowns at the feet of Him that ſits upon the Throne, joining in Conſort with the Celeſtial Quire of Saints and Angels in the Sacred Hymns of Divine Praiſes, and <hi>Allelujahs; Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power, to the Lord our God,</hi> (Rev. 19.1, to 10.) <hi>Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name, be the glory of all thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Works.</hi> Sing <hi>Zion,</hi> ſhout O ye Inhabitants of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> Judges 5.1, to 14. <hi>Awake</hi> Deborah, <hi>awake, awake, ſing to the Lord; Ariſe</hi> Barak, take the Harps of God in your hands, ye Heavenly Victors; and in your moſt ſtrenuous Notes, ſing aloud with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb upon your Chryſtal fiery Floods: Rev. 15.2, 3, 4. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty; Juſt and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints, who will not fear thee, O God, and glorify thy Name? for thou only art Holy; all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy Judgments are made manifeſt.</hi> And again, <hi>Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, and is manifeſt to be All in All, all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in all Variety.</hi> Thus to aſcribe to God All in all, and to the Creature-Nothing, is the top-Stone of God's Building, to which we cry, <hi>Grace, Grace.
